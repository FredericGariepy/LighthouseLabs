Configure Apache Web Server

Here are 5 problems. Understand how each is a probem & how you will fix it.
- The servers have the root user available to be accessed by SSH.
- The sudoers file had a lot of unnecessary permissions, such as the database user.
- Many web servers have Python installed without needing it.
- The Syslog was disabled when the system administrator worked on a proof of concept (POC) for a new centralized log analyzer, and they did the POC in the production environment.
- All servers are using HTTP and it's possible to use a sniffer and a network protocol analyzer, such as Wireshark, on the network.
