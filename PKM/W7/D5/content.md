## Diamond Model
Center for Cyber Threat Intelligence and Threat Research - Diamond Model - est. 2013

It’s a model of Intrusion Analysis that is used to describe cyberattacks \
contains four parts: adversary, infrastructure, capability, and target. \
It helps to describe how to map an attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to build up threat intelligence.

Diamond Model adds value to cyber intelligence through a deep understanding of the infrastructure and capabilities of both victim and adversary.
