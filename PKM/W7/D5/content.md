## Diamond Model
Center for Cyber Threat Intelligence and Threat Research - Diamond Model - est. 2013

It’s a model of Intrusion Analysis that is used to describe cyberattacks \
contains four parts: adversary, infrastructure, capability, and target. \
It helps to describe how to map an attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to build up threat intelligence.

Diamond Model adds value to cyber intelligence through a deep understanding of the infrastructure and capabilities of both victim and adversary.

## MITRE ATT&CK 
MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK). \
[Intro](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/) \
[Get started](https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/getting-started-with-attack-october-2019.pdf)

TTP \
Tech Domain > Tactic > Techniques > Sub-techniques > Procedures

ATT&CK Framework adds value to cyber threat intelligence through the study of used tactics, techniques, and tools

## Caldera
https://github.com/mitre/caldera \
Caldera automates and tests systems against selected techniques in the ATT&CK Matrix.
- You begin by installing Caldera on your network.
- Then install service agents on your network that you would like to test.
- Your attack can be customized and configured through the Caldera GUI.


Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has developed a best practices guide to map MITRE ATT&CK against incidents.
