STEP 1: Case Studies

If you haven't already done so, you will read and discuss case studies and documentation from historical attacks, with discussion questions. These discussions help prepare you for the analysis and reporting you will do in the project.
Question

What is required to complete this step?

Discuss one or two case studies with your peers.
STEP 2: Company Scenario

You will read through the company profile scenarios that you will use throughout your project.
Question

What is required to complete this step?

Read the company profile and mark the activity as complete.
STEP 3: Write an Email Report to your Manager

Based on the company scenario, you will write a report to your manager with specific reccommendations for the company's security landscpe. Guidelines for key points will be found in Compass. This part of the assignment consolidates tasks that you have completed before. The email report to your manager will not be evaluated - if you would like feedback, we encourage you to speak to a mentor.
Question

What is required to complete this step?

Submit your email report as a Google doc link (with open access permissions) through Compass. Once submitted, move on to the next step of the assignment.
STEP 4: The Threat Scenario

Now that you have considered the security needs of the company, itâ€™s time to put them to the test. You will be given a simulated threat scenario based on the company profile. The scenario will include relevant artifacts to help you analyze the attack.
Question

What is required to complete this step?

Read the threat scenario and download the artifacts.
STEP 5: Incident Response Report
Note

Your submissions will not be evaluated but will be checked to monitor your progress. If you would like feedback on your submissions, please reach out to a mentor.

The majority of your time on this project will be spent on this step. You will analyze the artifacts and threat scenario and, using this information, create an incident response report tailored for your manager. Many of these tasks will be familiar from previous coursework and you will find guidelines of key points on Compass. Be sure to dedicate time for the analysis of the artifacts.
Question

What is required to complete this step?

Submit your report as a Google doc link (with open access permissions) through Compass.
STEP 6: Demo Day Presentation

There are a lot of possible topics of discussion in this project. To ensure you are able to speak in detail within the 5 minute timeframe, you will choose one of the topics listed below to focus on for your presentation.

Aim to complete your report by this Sunday, allowing you to dedicate next week to perfecting your presentation. Further instructions for Demo Day will be provided later. Your primary focus for this week will be completing your report.
