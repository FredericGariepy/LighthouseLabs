Common Tools and Resources Used:
- Network Scanners: Tools like __Nmap__ and __Nessus__ are used to scan and identify devices, services, and
open ports on the network. This helps in understanding the network's attack surface and potential
vulnerabilities.

- Vulnerability Assessment Tools: These tools, such as __OpenVAS__ and __Qualys__, help identify known
vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and network components.

- Penetration Testing Tools: Tools like __Metasploit__ and __Burp Suite__ are used for active testing to simulate
potential attacks and assess how well security measures can withstand them.

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems: SIEM tools like __Splunk__, __ELK Stack__, or
__IBM QRadar__ help centralize and analyze security-related logs and events from various systems and
applications.

- Configuration Management Tools: Tools like __Ansible__ and __Puppet__ can help assess and manage the
security configurations of systems, ensuring consistent security settings across the organization

- Packet Capture and Analysis Tools: __Wireshark__ and __tcpdump__ are used to capture and analyze network traffic, helping to identify anomalies or suspicious activities.

- Security Assessment Frameworks: Frameworks like __MITRE ATT&CK__ and __OWASP__ provide
guidelines and resources for evaluating and addressing security threats and vulnerabilities.

- Security Policy and Compliance Tools: Tools like __OpenSCAP__ assist in assessing compliance with security standards and policies by scanning systems for adherence to predefined benchmarks.

- Security Audit Tools: These tools, such as __Lynis__ and __AIDE__, can perform security audits on systems to identify potential weaknesses.

- Password Crackers: Tools like __John the Ripper__ and __Hashcat__ help assess the strength of passwords by attempting to crack password hashes

- Network Monitoring Tools: Tools like __Snort__ and __Suricata__ assist in monitoring network traffic for signs of suspicious or malicious activity.

- __Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Tools__: DLP solutions like __Symantec DLP__ or __McAfee DLP__ help monitor and control the movement of sensitive data within the organization.

- Security Documentation Templates: Predefined templates for __security policies__, __incident response plans__, and other security-related documents provide a framework for creating comprehensive security documentation.

- Online Resources and Communities: Security professionals often refer to online resources, blogs, forums, and communities like Stack Exchange and Reddit's r/netsec for advice, guidance, and discussions on security architecture.

- Consultants and Experts: In addition to tools, engaging with security experts and consultants can provide valuable insights and expertise during the security architecture review process.
