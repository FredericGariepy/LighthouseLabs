Amazon has a lot of Labor day type sales on now - but  I bought :
Beelink Ser5- 16g ram, 8C/16T, 512gb NVME earlier this year.
Sure, I updated the RAM and added in a 4tb ssd,
but the basics work for a couple of constant on "full" VM's.
RAM is easy upgrade - dual slots,
and drive expansion was easy - single NVME, but room for a 2.5" SATA drive.
Price: $325 approx
