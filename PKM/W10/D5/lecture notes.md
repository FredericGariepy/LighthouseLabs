Common Tools and Resources Used:
- Network Scanners: Tools like __Nmap__ and __Nessus__ are used to scan and identify devices, services, and
open ports on the network. This helps in understanding the network's attack surface and potential
vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability Assessment Tools: These tools, such as __OpenVAS__ and __Qualys__, help identify known
vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and network components.
- Penetration Testing Tools: Tools like __Metasploit__ and __Burp Suite__ are used for active testing to simulate
potential attacks and assess how well security measures can withstand them.
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems: SIEM tools like __Splunk__, __ELK Stack__, or
__IBM QRadar__ help centralize and analyze security-related logs and events from various systems and
applications.
- Configuration Management Tools: Tools like __Ansible__ and __Puppet__ can help assess and manage the
security configurations of systems, ensuring consistent security settings across the organization
