- Secure configurations:
> establish and maintaining secure configurations for network devices, servers, workstations, and applications.
>
> Hardening systems, disabling unnecessary services, applying security patches, and using strong and unique passwords or authentication mechanisms.

- Network Segmentation:
> dividing a network into multiple subnetworks or segments to enhance security.
>
>  network incident are contained, limiting lateral movement and reducing the attack surface.
- Secure Remote Access:
> secure methods for remote access to network resources.
> 
> VPNs, two-factor authentication, strong encryption, SSH.
- Continuous Monitoring:
> ongoing process of observing and analyzing network activities to detect potential security incidents, anomalous behavior, or policy violations.
>  It involves using security information and event management (SIEM) systems, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and log analysis tools to proactively identify and respond to security events.

- Incident Response:
> Well-defined and documented incident response plan.
>
> processes and procedures to effectively respond to and mitigate security incidents, such as data breaches, malware infections, or network intrusions. It encompasses incident detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.

- Encryption:
> principles, algorithms, key management, secure information in transit and at rest.
- User Awareness & Education:
> Promoting a security-conscious culture (minimize human errors).
