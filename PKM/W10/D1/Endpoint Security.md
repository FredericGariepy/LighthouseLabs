# Endpoint Security Controls:
> It involves deploying, configuring, monitoring, and maintaining security measures to protect endpoints such as desktops, laptops, servers, smartphones, tablets, IT, IoT, Cloud, from cyber threats and unauthorized access.
>
> Goal: encusre CIA of resources, mitigate risks

## Device policy
Bring your own (BYO-) D-device, IT-infra, C-cloud \
BYO- polciies are either: Well-defined _or_ Poorly-defined \
BYO- policy components:
- consent (Monitor, Usage, Wipe)
- software (version, required apps, denied apps)
- hardware (Type, versions)
- services (Authorized services)


### Endpoint Protection Solutions:
Deployment of endpoint protection solutions:
- antivirus/anti-malware software,
- firewalls,
- Intrusion prevention systems (IPS),
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR),
- data loss prevention (DLP) tools,
- advanced threat detection technologies (behavioral analysis, machine learning)
### Centralized Management Console:
Control center for endpoint security management. \
Monitor and Manage security settings, policies, and configurations for all endpoints from a single interface
### Patch Management
- Keeping software and firmware up-to-date
- Update known vulnerabilities knowledge, patch.
### Security Policy Enforcement
Implementation and enforcement of security polciies across endpoints and user roles
- access controls
- application whitelisting/blacklisting
- USB device restrictions
- data encryption rules
- etc..
### Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
EDR solutions are used to:
- monitor endpoint activities in real-time
- detect suspicious behavior
- respond to security incidents.

EDR tools provide detailed endpoint visibility, threat hunting capabilities, and incident response functionalities.

### Mobile Device Management (MDM):
secure & manage smartphones, tablets within the corporate network.
MDM:
- enforce security policies
- manage applications
- remotely wipe devices if lost or stolen.

### User Authentication and Access Control:
- MFA
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html
- Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview

### Endpoint Encryption: Endpoint security management may involve deploying encryption solutions to protect data at rest and in transit on endpoints. Encryption helps safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access, even if the device is lost or stolen.

Endpoint Security Awareness Training: Educating users about endpoint security best practices and the importance of adhering to security policies is vital. Security awareness training helps create a security-conscious culture within the organization and reduces the risk of human error leading to security incidents.
