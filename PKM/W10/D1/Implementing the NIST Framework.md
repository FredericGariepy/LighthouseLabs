Key Takeaways
- The NIST Framework is a vital guide for: \
  managing and reducing cybersecurity risks \
  and can be tailored to fit organizations of various sizes and sectors.
- The framework is structured around five core functions \
  Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover \
  that provide a systematic approach to managing cybersecurity risks.
- Implementing the NIST Framework requires \
  understanding the organization's unique risk landscape \
  and tailoring the framework to effectively manage these risks.
# Small Business
A small business with limited resources can effectively implement the NIST Framework by:
- Prioritizing their assets and focusing on protecting the most critical ones first.
- Utilizing the Identify function to understand and document their risk landscape.
- Implementing basic and cost-effective safeguards under the Protect function, such as strong password policies and regular software updates.
- Setting up simple monitoring tools under the Detect function to identify abnormal activities.
- Developing a clear and straightforward incident response plan under the Respond function.
- Creating a basic recovery plan under the Recover function to ensure they can quickly restore operations after an incident.
- Leveraging free resources and guidelines provided by NIST and other cybersecurity organizations to guide their implementation efforts.
