__continuous Learning and Improvement__: non-stop.

### Security Principles
##### Defense in Depth
NO single point of Failure.

Security layers: \
auth _enticate_, auth _orize_,just-in-time auth, Deny rules (implicit, explicit), Zero trust  

Combination of: \
preventive, detective, and responsive measures at
Layers:
- network
- host
- application
- data

##### Least Priviledge:
Temporary access to necessary and required parties to complete operations.
1. Access rights: (role,JIT)
2. Hardening: remove vulneralble serices (cut/slim down attack surface)
3. priviledge creep: Monitor access rights, Modify access rights
4. Just in Case: Review access rights, do not overextend attribution.

##### Seperation of Duties
_anti-dictatorship_ \
No single individual has complete control or authority over critical process or resource.
- concept of _forced collusion_

##### Secure by Design
Developement, Operations, Maintenance _left shift_
Developement, Operations, __left shift__, Maintenance
Developement, __left shift__, Operations, Maintenance
 __Left Shift__, Developement, Operations, Maintenance
