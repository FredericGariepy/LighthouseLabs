NIST RMF steps:

Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Asses, Authorize, Monitor
_________________________
NIST CSF version 1 Steps: \
Identify, Protect, Detect, Response, Recover

NIST CSF version 2 steps: \
Govern (center), Identify, Protect, Detect, Response, Recover
_______________________
NIST CSF vs. ISO 27001:
- CSF is a guide, ISO is a compliance standard.
- ISO requires an audit for certification, CSF offers no certification as it is a guide.
- Mature organizations will tend to ISO certification, early stage organizations will tend to start with CSF.
- CSF is FREE, ISO is not.

Policy steps: \
Statement, Implementation, Compliance and Consequence, Review and Update
_________
IR steps: \
Prepare, Detection + Analysis, Containment + Eradication + Recovery, Post-Incident Activity

Diamond Model:

https://www.eccouncil.org/cybersecurity-exchange/ethical-hacking/diamond-model-intrusion-analysis/

Diamond Model 4 components:
- Adversary
> The attacker or group responsible for a cyber incident.
- Infrastructure
> The technical resources or assets the adversary uses during the attack (e.g., servers, domains, and IP addresses).
- Capability
> A method, tool, or technique the adversary uses during the attack (e.g., malware or exploits).
- Victim
>â€¯The individual or organization the adversary targets during the attack.
_____________________________________________
Cybersecurity Team roles (Blue, Red, Purple):
- Red: Attacker
- Blue: Defender
- Purple: Defender learns from attacker
