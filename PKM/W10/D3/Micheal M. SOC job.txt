So I am pretty sure you applied for SOC - CORE. This position is more of a "mid-level" positon that we have in our organization. These Analysts are in charge of Firewall and Network Packet Inspection. Essentially think of almost anything Network; this is what CORE is in charge of. Thats why you may have seen 5 years as a requirement as it does take a little more of a technical understanding to excel in this positon.

SOC - MXDR is where I am placed. My "real" title is MXDR - Security Analyst of when I first started. MXDR is in charge of Managed Extended Detection and Response (MXDR) or in other words Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). We are in charge using different endpoint platforms such as our in house product, Microsoft Defender, Fortinet Products and much more. (BTW you can publicly find this info on our website).

In my personal case, I am apart of the MXDR team, however I'm no longer a MXDR Analyst. I now specialize in Cloud Security, specifically Microsoft Defender & Sentinel. As for spots open in my team; not much is available as the company is still trying to save up some funds before expanding the teams across the different departments. 

Also we have our own Conference happening in MTL on September 11 & 12 called "GoSec". There isn't any student prices as its not targetted towards students and more towards our clients and potentially newcomers that may be interested in our services. That being said; anyone is invited physically if you purchase your ticket. I know last year I actually saw a handful of McGill students who are in our program who attended and even Martin from Incident Response was there
