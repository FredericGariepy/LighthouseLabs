# About
About the reading:
- __Document Purpose__: standardize incident response practices
- __Steps__: preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activities.

Document contains two playbooks:
1. Incident response
2. Vulnerability response

## Incident response
####  Preparation Activitie
- [ ] To be completed

#### Detection & Analysis
- [x] Great table, See page 12 [Example Adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Relevant Log and Event Data](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf)
#### Containment Activities
- [x] See Below; Short-term mitigations, Eradicaition activities.
##### short-term mitigations:
- Isolating impacted systems and network segments (consider mission or business needs)
- Capture forensic, (images, videos, logs, etc)
- Updating firewall filtering.
- Blocking (and logging) of unauthorized accesses; blocking malware sources.
- Closing specific ports and mail servers or other relevant servers and services.
- Changing system admin passwords, rotating private keys, and service/application account secrets where compromise is suspected and revocation of privileged access.
- Directing the adversary to a sandbox (a form of containment) to monitor the actor’s activity, gather additional evidence, and identify attack vectors.
- Note: this containment activity is limited to advanced SOCs with mature capabilities
##### Eradicaition activities
- Remediating all infected IT environments (e.g., cloud, OT, hybrid, host, and network systems).
- Reimaging affected systems (often from ‘gold’ sources), rebuilding systems from scratch.
- Rebuilding hardware (required when the incident involves rootkits).
- Replacing compromised files with clean versions.
- Installing patches.
- Resetting passwords on compromised accounts.
- Monitoring for any signs of adversary response to containment activities
- Developing response scenarios for threat actor use of alternative attack vectors.
- Allowing adequate time to ensure all systems are clear of all possible threat actor persistence mechanisms (backdoors, etc.) as adversaries often use more than one mechanism.

###### Recover System(s) and Services
- Reconnecting rebuilt/new systems to networks.
- Tightening perimeter security (e.g., firewall rulesets, boundary router access control lists) and zero trust access rules.
- Testing systems thoroughly, including security controls.
- Monitoring operations for abnormal behaviors.

#### Post-Incident Activities
- [ ] To be completed
