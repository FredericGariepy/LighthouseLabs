# RMF Stage 2 - Selecting Controls (Part One)
## Stage 2, breakdown:
- selecting controls
- tailoring controls
- documenting controls

As specified by NIST, outcomes of this stage are:

Control baselines selected and tailored \
Controls designated as system-specific, hybrid, or common \
Controls allocated to specific system components \
System-level continuous monitoring strategy developed \
Security and privacy plans that reflect the control selection, designation, and allocation are reviewed and approved \

# tasks of the Select stage (1,2,3,4):
### Task 1 - Common Control Identification:
identify the security controls that are provided by the organization as common controls for organizational information systems and document the controls in a security plan (or equivalent document).

### Task 2 - Security Control Selection/System-Specific Control Selection:
select the security controls for the information system and document the controls in the security plan.


### Task 3 - Monitoring Strategy:
develop a strategy for the continuous monitoring of security control effectiveness and any proposed or actual changes to the information system and its environment of operation.

### Task 4 - Security Plan Approval:
review and approve the security plan.

#### Common Controls vs. System-Specific Controls

Common controls are controls that support multiple systems efficiently and effectively as a common capability. 
 - Common controls = __inherited controls__

System-specific controls provide a capability for a particular system only and are the primary responsibility of system owners and their respective authorizing officials. 
- An example: IA-6 AUTHENTICATION FEEDBACK, designed to obscure the feedback of authentication information during the authentication process.

### Task 1.
- __Identify__ common controls in organization.
- __document__ the controls in a security plan (or equivalent document).

### Security Control Family (NIST) SP 800-53
Hierarchy in control family; begin with a base control family (broadest set). Then, branches to one or more sub-control families (sub-sets).
