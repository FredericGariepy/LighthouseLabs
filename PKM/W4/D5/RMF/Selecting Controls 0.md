## Select Stage (stage 2), breakdown:
- selecting controls
- tailoring controls
- documenting controls

As specified by NIST, outcomes of this stage are:

Control baselines selected and tailored \
Controls designated as system-specific, hybrid, or common \
Controls allocated to specific system components \
System-level continuous monitoring strategy developed \
Security and privacy plans that reflect the control selection, designation, and allocation are reviewed and approved \

# tasks of the Select stage (1,2,3,4):
### Task 1 - Common Control Identification:
