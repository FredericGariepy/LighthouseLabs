# RMF Step 3 - Implementing security controls.
Resource: page 28-29 [NIST SP800-37r1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-37r1.pdf)
Two key tasks:
1. __Implement security controls__:
    Integrate security early, allocate controls to specific components, and use best practices. Consider independently evaluated products and additional measures for high-impact systems.

3. __Document implementation__:
Describe how controls are implemented, including functional details for technical controls.

Throughout the process, consider enterprise architecture, coordinate with common control providers, and conduct initial assessments during development.

The goal is early identification of weaknesses for cost-effectiveness.

Utilize existing documentation and automated tools when possible to improve efficiency.
