# Key Takeaways
The control selection process can be summarized as follows:

- Choosing an initial set of controls, including __common controls__ and controls selected from a control baseline or __organization-generated controls__.
- __Tailoring the baseline controls__ by applying scoping, parameterization (i.e., assigning values to assignment and selection operations where called within the controls), and compensating control guidance
- As part of the tailoring process, __supplementing the baseline controls with additional controls__
or control enhancements to address unique organizational needs based on a risk assessment and local conditions,
including the environment of operation, organization-specific security and privacy requirements, 
specific threat information, cost-benefit analysis, or special circumstances
- Providing additional details to ensure that control implementation fully __meets security and privacy requirement__

## Security Control Baseline
security control baseline = set of security controls selected to address the security requirements of an information system.

## Common (Inheritable) Controls
Things like: Network Firewalls, Antivirus, Centralized logs, Patch Management Programs, ...
