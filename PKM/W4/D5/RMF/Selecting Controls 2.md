# RMF Stage 2 - Selecting Controls (Part Two)
- ~~Task 1: Common Control Identification~~
- ~~Task 2: Security Control Selection/ System-specific Control Selection~~
- Task 3: Monitoring Strategy
- Task 4: Security Plan Approval

> Controls are actionable points of contact. \
> They can be static obstacles (permissions, physical blocks, firewall rules, password, hashes, encryption)
> They can be dynamic/traps (changes in permission, actuators, automatic reconfigs, conditonal actions) \
 
# Task 3 of Select: Develop Monitoring Strategy
- develop a strategy for the continuous monitoring
- proposed or actual changes to the information system

An effective monitoring strategy is developed early in the system development life cycle (SDLC).

monitoring program includes:
- configuration management and control processes
- security impact analyses on proposed or actual changes to the information system and its environment of operation
- assessment of security controls employed within and inherited by the information system (including controls in dynamic subsystems)
- security status reporting to appropriate organizational officials.The continuous monitoring strategy for the information system identifies the security controls to be monitored, the frequency of monitoring, and the control assessment approach. 

The monitoring frequency reflects the priorities/importance of information system to organizational operations.

The authorizing official approves the security controls, their monitoring frquency.

The approval of the monitoring strategy can be obtained in conjunction with the security plan approval.

# Task 4 of Select: Approve Security Plans
Independent auditors review and approve the security plan.

Approval allows the Risk Management process to advance to the next step in the RMF (i.e., the implementation of the security controls).
