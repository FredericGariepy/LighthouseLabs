InfoSec Risk Assessment

Tools:
- NIST RMF
- Risk Assessment Checklist
    - Ensure repeated assement (recuring audit, regular security posture check)
    - Update checklist (missing , discovery, new systems)
    - Aid in mitigation process
    - Aid in documentation for compliance requirements

## Risk Assessment Checklist
> Can vary depending on the organization, its assets and what specific assets they are assessing.

Risk Assesment Basics:
1. Thoroughly investigate all assets that are being evaluated
2. Consider the assets and their security from as many angles as possible
    - Full range of tools used to secure an organization and its assets
    - People, Procedures, and Technologies put in place and maintained.
3. Internal/External sources of effect on the organization and its assets

Areas to Address on Your NIST SP 800-171 Checklist

14 families of security requirements needed to address NIST SP 800-171 checklist. 

#### Access Controls
Access control centers around who has access to CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information) in your information systems. 
To comply with NIST SP 800-171, you must ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data in the information systems of federal agencies. 

- Access controls must use __least privilege and separation of duties__.
- Access control measures include: User account management, failed login protocols.
- Consider increasing access controls for users with privileged access and remote access.
- Create formalized and documented security policy as to how you plan to enforce your access security controls.  

#### Awareness and Training
Properly trained their employees on how to handle CUI and other sensitive information. 

- Employees are familiar with the security risks associated with their jobs, plus all the policies, including your security policy and procedures.

#### Audit and Accountability
Create and keep system audit logs and records, that will allow you or your auditors to monitor, analyze, investigate and report any suspicious activity within your information systems.

- Actions in IS (information systems) are associated with a specific user, so that individual can be held accountable.
- Retain records of __who__ authorized what information, and whether that user was authorized to do so.
- Identifying external and internal data authorization violators is the main thrust of the NIST SP 800-171 audit and accountability standard.

#### Configuration Management
Documented the configuration of networks and cybersecurity protocols.

How your network is configured can entail a number of variables and information systems, including hardware, software, and firmware.

- Analyze your baseline systems configuration, monitor configuration changes, and identify any user-installed software that might be related to CUI.

#### Identification and Authentication
Authenticate (or verify) identities of users, before you grant them IS access.
- NIST SP 800-171 states that you have to identify and authenticate all users, processes, and devices, which means they can only access your information systems via approved, secure devices.

- Consider  MFA (multi-factor authentication) for authenticating employees who are accessing the network remotely or via their mobile devices.
- Ensure they create complex passwords, and they don’t reuse their passwords on other websites.

- NIST 800-171 internal audit of your security policies and processes to be sure you’re fully compliant.

#### Incident Response
NIST SP 800-171 mandates that you have an incident response plan in place that includes elements of preparation, threat detection, and analysis of what has happened.

- Detail how to contain the cybersecurity threat, recover critical information systems and data, and outline what tasks your users will need to take.
- Guidelines to alert designated officials, authorities, and any other relevant stakeholders about an incident in a timely manner.  

- Testing the 6 stage incident response plan.

#### Maintenance
Perform routine maintenance of your information systems and cybersecurity measures. 
- Establish a timeline of when maintenance will be done and who will be responsible for doing it. 
- Provide effective controls on the tools, techniques, mechanisms, and personnel used to conduct maintenance on your information systems. 

#### Media Protection
NIST SP 800-171 requires that you protect, physically control, and securely store information system media that contain CUI, both paper and digital.

- Assess storage of electronic, hard copy records.
- Ensure store of backups securely.
- Only authorized personnel have access to these media devices or hardware. 

#### Personnel Security
Screen new employees, background checks, before they are authorized on IS that contain CUI.

- Revoke the access of terminated users, or users that depart/separate from the organization, or get transferred. 

#### Physical Protection
Secure all CUI that exists in physical form.

- Ensure that only authorized users have access to your information systems, equipment, and storage environments.
- Be sure you lock and secure your physical CUI properly.
- Escort and monitor visitors to your facility, so they aren’t able to gain access to physical CUI. 

#### Risk Assessment (also called Risk Analysis)
Assess the risks to your operations, including mission, functions, image, and reputation.
 > A risk assessment is a key to the development and implementation of effective information security programs.

- Assess your organizational assets and people that stem from the operation of your information systems and the associated processing, storage, and/or transmission of CUI.

- Are you regularly testing your defenses in simulations?
- How regularly are you verifying operations and individuals for security purposes?

> You can use the results of your risk assessment to establish detailed courses of action so you can effectively respond to the identified risks as part of a broad-based risk management process. 

#### Security Assessment
Periodically assess the security controls in your information systems to determine if they’re effective.
> Because cybersecurity threats change frequently, the policy you established one year might need to be revised the next year. 

- Set up periodic cybersecurity review plans and procedures so your security measures won’t become outdated.
- To comply with the security assessment requirement, you have to consistently review your information systems, implement a continuous improvement plan, and quickly address any issues as soon as you discover them. 

#### System and Communications Protection 
To communicate or share CUI with other authorized organizations, sets standards for the systems you use to transmit CUI, as well as the cybersecurity measures that you should take.
 - You should regularly monitor your information system security controls to ensure they remain effective.

#### System and Information Integrity 
The system and information integrity requirement of NIST SP 800-171 covers how quickly you can detect, identify, report, and correct potential system flaws and cybersecurity threats. 
- Regularly update your patch management capabilities and malicious code protection software.
