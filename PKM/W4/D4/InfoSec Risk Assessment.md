InfoSec Risk Assessment

Tools:
- NIST RMF
- Risk Assessment Checklist
    - Ensure repeated assement (recuring audit, regular security posture check)
    - Update checklist (missing , discovery, new systems)
    - Aid in mitigation process
    - Aid in documentation for compliance requirements

## Risk Assessment Checklist
> Can vary depending on the organization, its assets and what specific assets they are assessing.

Risk Assesment Basics:
1. Thoroughly investigate all assets that are being evaluated
2. Consider the assets and their security from as many angles as possible
    - Full range of tools used to secure an organization and its assets
    - People, Procedures, and Technologies put in place and maintained.
3. Internal/External sources of effect on the organization and its assets



Areas to Address on Your NIST SP 800-171 Checklist

14 families of security requirements needed to address NIST SP 800-171 checklist. 
#### Access Controls
Access control centers around who has access to CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information) in your information systems. To comply with NIST SP 800-171, you must ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data in the information systems of federal agencies. 

You should include user account management and failed login protocols in your access control measures. You should also consider increasing your access controls for users with privileged access and remote access.  Access controls must also cover the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. It is essential to create a formalized and documented security policy as to how you plan to enforce your access security controls.  

#### Awareness and Training

This section of the NIST SP 800-171 focuses on whether organizations have properly trained their employees on how to handle CUI and other sensitive information. 

That means you have to be sure that all of your employees are familiar with the security risks associated with their jobs, plus all the policies, including your security policy and procedures.
Audit and Accountability

You’ll also have to create and keep system audit logs and records that will allow you or your auditors to monitor, analyze, investigate and report any suspicious activity within your information systems. And any action in your information systems has to be clearly associated with a specific user so that individual can be held accountable.

Consequently, you’ll need to retain records of who authorized what information, and whether that user was authorized to do so. Identifying external and internal data authorization violators is the main thrust of the NIST SP 800-171 audit and accountability standard.
Configuration Management

This deals with how you’ve built your networks and cybersecurity protocols and whether you’ve documented the configuration accurately. How your network is configured can entail a number of variables and information systems, including hardware, software, and firmware.

Be sure to analyze your baseline systems configuration, monitor configuration changes, and identify any user-installed software that might be related to CUI.
Identification and Authentication

Be sure to authenticate (or verify) the identities of users before you grant them access to your company’s information systems. Specifically, NIST SP 800-171 states that you have to identify and authenticate all users, processes, and devices, which means they can only access your information systems via approved, secure devices.

Consider using multi-factor authentication when you’re authenticating employees who are accessing the network remotely or via their mobile devices. You should also ensure they create complex passwords, and they don’t reuse their passwords on other websites. 

You also might want to conduct a NIST 800-171 internal audit of your security policies and processes to be sure you’re fully compliant.
Incident Response

In the event of a data breach or cybersecurity threat, NIST SP 800-171 mandates that you have an incident response plan in place that includes elements of preparation, threat detection, and analysis of what has happened.

Also, you must detail how you’ll contain the cybersecurity threat, recover critical information systems and data, and outline what tasks your users will need to take. You also must establish reporting guidelines so that you can alert designated officials, authorities, and any other relevant stakeholders about an incident in a timely manner.  

Essentially, these controls require an organization to establish an operational incident handling capability for systems that includes preparation, detection, analysis, containment, recovery, and user response activities.  Testing the incident response plan is also an integral part of the overall capability.  
Maintenance

Under NIST SP 800-171, you are required to perform routine maintenance of your information systems and cybersecurity measures. That means you must establish a timeline of when maintenance will be done and who will be responsible for doing it. 

You also need to provide effective controls on the tools, techniques, mechanisms, and personnel used to conduct maintenance on your information systems. 
Media Protection

NIST SP 800-171 requires that you protect, physically control, and securely store information system media that contain CUI, both paper and digital. So you need to assess how you store your electronic and hard copy records on various media and ensure that you also store backups securely.  Only authorized personnel should have access to these media devices or hardware. 
Personnel Security

Be sure you screen new employees and submit them to background checks before you authorize them to access your information systems that contain CUI. It’s also critical to revoke the access of users who are terminated, depart/separate from the organization, or get transferred. 
Physical Protection

According to NIST SP 800-171, you are required to secure all CUI that exists in physical form. Ensure that only authorized users have access to your information systems, equipment, and storage environments. Be sure you lock and secure your physical CUI properly. You also need to escort and monitor visitors to your facility, so they aren’t able to gain access to physical CUI. 
Risk Assessment (also called Risk Analysis)

Assess the risks to your operations, including mission, functions, image, and reputation. Assess your organizational assets and people that stem from the operation of your information systems and the associated processing, storage, and/or transmission of CUI.

For example: Are you regularly testing your defenses in simulations? How regularly are you verifying operations and individuals for security purposes?

A risk assessment is a key to the development and implementation of effective information security programs. A risk assessment can help you address a number of cybersecurity-related issues from advanced persistent threats to supply chain issues. 

You can use the results of your risk assessment to establish detailed courses of action so you can effectively respond to the identified risks as part of a broad-based risk management process. 
Security Assessment

Periodically assess the security controls in your information systems to determine if they’re effective. Because cybersecurity threats change frequently, the policy you established one year might need to be revised the next year. 

Set up periodic cybersecurity review plans and procedures so your security measures won’t become outdated. To comply with the security assessment requirement, you have to consistently review your information systems, implement a continuous improvement plan, and quickly address any issues as soon as you discover them. 
System and Communications Protection 

At some point, you’ll likely need to communicate or share CUI with other authorized organizations. As such, NIST SP 800-171 sets standards for the systems you use to transmit CUI, as well as the cybersecurity measures that you should take. You should regularly monitor your information system security controls to ensure they remain effective.
System and Information Integrity 

The system and information integrity requirement of NIST SP 800-171 covers how quickly you can detect, identify, report, and correct potential system flaws and cybersecurity threats. It’s also important to regularly update your patch management capabilities and malicious code protection software.
