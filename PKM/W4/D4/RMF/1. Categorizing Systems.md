### Security plan :world_map:
A security plan documents:
- Implementation of the risk management process :gear:
- and describes the system security posture. :mouse_trap:
Results of the security categorization are put in the security plan.

## Categorize


### Security Categorization SC
SC<sub>Information</sub> = {(C:val),(I:val),(A:val)} \
SC<sub>Information System</sub> =  {(C:val),(I:val),(A:val)}

SC<sub>__System__</sub> =  Max Value from both(SC<sub>Information</sub> __&__ SC<sub>Information System</sub>) \ 
SC<sub>__System__</sub> =   {(C:max val),(I:max val),(A:max val)}

SC<sub>__System__</sub> =  Max Value of ( {(C:max val),(I:max val),(A:max val)} ) = highest value over all. \
SC<sub>__System__</sub>  =  highest value over all. = SIL


__Categorize__ → Select → Implement → Assess → Authorize → Monitor \
As defined by NIST, **outcomes** of the Categorize stage are:
- System characteristics documented
- Security categorization of the system and information completed
- Categorization decision reviewed/approved by authorizing official


There are _three tasks_ that needs to be completed in the __Categorize __stage: \
Three tasks in Categorize stage: Categorize, Describe and Register
1. Categorize: security categorization.
2. Describe: information system description
3. Register: information system registration

_Why is the Register step at the end?_
> In case you wonder why the Register step is at the end, here is a brief explanation: Before you register any system in the enterprise IT registry, you must know the impact of security failure on this particular system (in other words, determine the security categorization of the system) and sufficient characteristics of the system (in other words, information system description). If you have all of the information ready for a system, it can be added (or registered) to the enterprise IT registry, and hence Register is the final step.

RMF, systems are categorized by the impact resulting from failures of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. \
Note, confidentiality failures cannot be fixed after they have occurred. You could try to limit the damage or prevent recurrence.

### Classifying the Consequences of Security Breaches (NIST vs. ISO)
- NIST: asset_CIA =(H, M, L), For Vulnerability, Impact/likelyhood matrix.
> NIST and ISO 27000 have the same objective but their methods differ. NIST uses a matrix that characterizes systems as a whole. Using NIST, it looks at the impact failures from the lens of the CIA. Here the impact is characterized as High, Moderate, or Low, resulting in a one-letter characterization (H, M, L).

- ISO: For Asset; Impact=chose(range 0-4), Likelyhood=chose(range 0-4), consequences of security breaches =  Impact + Likelyhood.
ISO, on the other hand, uses a multi-tiered approach. It identifies assets and assigns values to assets on a scale of 0 to 4. It then identifies risks to assets (Impact versus Likelihood) on a scale of 0 to 4. It uses a matrix that adds value and risk numbers to produce a per-asset system score from 0 to 8. System score is the sum of all individual asset scores.

## Roles
There are multiple key roles in an enterprise that need to be involved in risk assessment and management, such as Chief Information Officer (CIO), Senior Information Security Officer (SISO), IT Manager, etc.

As a Blue Team member, you may have to work at the role of a 
- System Administrator
- System Owner
- System Security or Privacy Engineer
- System Security or Privacy Officer
You may go back to the reading and look at the duties and responsibilities of these roles more closely.
