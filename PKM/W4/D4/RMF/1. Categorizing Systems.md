## Categorize
__Categorize__ → Select → Implement → Assess → Authorize → Monitor \
As defined by NIST, **outcomes** of the Categorize stage are:
- System characteristics documented
- Security categorization of the system and information completed
- Categorization decision reviewed/approved by authorizing official


There are _three tasks_ that needs to be completed in the __Categorize __stage: \
Three tasks in Categorize stage: Categorize, Describe and Register
1. Categorize: security categorization.
2. Describe: information system description
3. Register: information system registration

__Why__ the __Register__ step is ___at the end?___
> In case you wonder why the Register step is at the end, here is a brief explanation: Before you register any system in the enterprise IT registry, you must know the impact of security failure on this particular system (in other words, determine the security categorization of the system) and sufficient characteristics of the system (in other words, information system description). If you have all of the information ready for a system, it can be added (or registered) to the enterprise IT registry, and hence Register is the final step.

## Roles
There are multiple key roles in an enterprise that need to be involved in risk assessment and management, such as Chief Information Officer (CIO), Senior Information Security Officer (SISO), IT Manager, etc.

As a Blue Team member, you may have to work at the role of a 
- System Administrator
- System Owner
- System Security or Privacy Engineer
- System Security or Privacy Officer
You may go back to the reading and look at the duties and responsibilities of these roles more closely.
