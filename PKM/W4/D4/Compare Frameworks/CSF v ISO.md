# Intro 
Are you shoppig for a framework? \

- [ISO Store (fuck that, just get a subsciption)](https://www.iso.org/store.html)
- [YEAHH! FREE NIST YEAAA!](https://www.nist.gov/)
You shouldn't get too hung up on Accronyms.

Risk management is three steps:
1.   Identify risks to the organization’s information 
2.   Implement controls appropriate to the risk
3.   Monitor their performance 

Got that? 3 steps. Risk managment, a.k.a. secure your shit framework. \
Don't follow an RMF that misses to cover your ends.

well then, you're in luck, this is the toyotathon of frameworks. \
And don't get your accronyms twisted! Dont confuse things like CSF with CSIRT. [Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT).](https://secureglobal.de/the-csirt-methodology)

First conider what the things you need in a framework:
- Suitability
- Feasibility
- Acceptability
- Explicitness
- Completeness
- Flexibility
- Scalability

Now here's the frameworks we've got here for you today \
Frameworks of focus for LHL:
- NIST SP 800-Series RMF
- ISO 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- NIST Security Frameworks (NIST RMF and NIST Cyber Security Framework [CSF]):

## NIST CSF 
Set of guidelines and best practices. (voluntary)
-  Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

## NIST RMF
A Comprehensive RMF that provides a structured process to manage risk. (mandatory for federal agencies.)
## ISO/IEC 27001
An information security management system (ISMS) \
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \
international standard framework for creating a comprehensive ISMS.


## NIST CSF :couple_with_heart: ISO 27001 - Complete me abby :people_hugging:
Completed your ISO 27001? you’ve achieved 60% of your NIST CSF. \
Instead, Complete NIST CSF and then you’re 78% of the way to the ISO 27001 finish line.

An important overlap area, in CSF and ISO 27001, is maintaining an asset register \
as recognized by Annex A.8.1 of ISO27001 for asset responsibility and ID.AM of NIST CSF for asset management.

### Diffrences :boxing_glove: NIST CSF -v. ISO 27001 :boom:
### CSF :baby: :older_man: ISO
The ISO 27001 offers a good certification choice for organizations that have operational maturity \
while the NIST CSF may be best suited for organizations that are in the initial stages of developing a cybersecurity risk program or attempting to mitigate breaches.

### CSF :free: :moneybag: ISO
NIST CSF is available free, ISO 27001 involves audits and certification, Cert valid for three years, surveillance audits for two years and in year three, they’ll complete a recertification audit. 

So start-ups will usually kick start their InfoSec program with NIST and work their way up to ISO 27001 as they scale.

## Other frameworks (unprocessesed text)

    HITRUST Common Security Framework (HITRUST CSF): the HITRUST CSF is designed to be a comprehensive set of security controls and processes used by healthcare organizations to protect patient information. The framework helps healthcare organizations adhere to HIPAA privacy regulations, as well as other industry-specific laws and standards.
    Cloud Security Alliance Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM): the Cloud Security Alliance's CCM provides organizations with guidelines on how to effectively manage cloud computing operations from a security perspective. It includes hundreds of best practice recommendations that address everything from user authentication to data storage management.
    SANS Critical Security Controls: the SANS Institute's Critical Security Controls are designed to provide IT professionals with an actionable roadmap for improving their organization's Cyber Security posture. The 20 critical security controls are grouped into three categories—identify, protect, and detect—making them easier to implement in any organization.
    CIS Benchmarks: CIS Benchmarks are sets of technical standards created by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). They are used as reference points for system administrators when configuring various types of technology, including OSs, applications, databases, and cloud services.
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance Checklist: theGDPR is an EU regulation that applies to any organization processing personal data belonging to EU citizens or residents. This GDPR compliance checklist provides guidelines on how organizations can meet the requirements set out in this legislation regarding protecting the privacy rights of individuals.
