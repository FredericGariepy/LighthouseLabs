Multi-Tiered Risk Management Strategy handles: operational risks & strategic risks.

operational risk management (ORM) handles operational risks.
NIST RMF handles operational risks.

Strategic and Operational Risks

 Risk two categories: 
- strategic (organization's ability to achieve its goals) AND tactical (impact day-to-day operations)
- operational

Examples of strategic risks are:
- Management team makes poor decisions, launching ineffective new products, etc.
- Company using technology that hinders their operations, for example, using on-premises IT instead of cloud-based services
- Consumer preferences changing, threatening your product offerings and value proposition

Examples of tactical risks are:
- Inadequate or failed internal processes
- System failures and downtime
- Poorly trained staff
- Cyber Security incidents, such as data breaches
- Fraud
- External events, such as natural disasters or pandemics

Multi-Tiered Risk Management Strategy (below):

```

1. Enterprise Tier (Tier 1): Governance
    - Executive Leaders: set priorities, create policies to achieve strategic objectives.
    - $ Investment strategy to achieve mission and risk prioritie
    - Frame organizationâ€™s risk and informs all other activities.
    - Enterprise Tier is expressed as policies; scope for Enterprise Tier is the entire organization
    - Tier 1 sets the direction for Tier 2 managers.

2. Business-Area Tier (Tier 2):
    - Tier 2 focuses on developing risk-informed mission processes that meet Enterprise goals.
    - Administration of an enterprise architecture
    - $ Budget: Establishment of a consistent information system architecture
    - Business-Area Tier is expressed as processes. Its scope is a business, with parts having some autonomy.
    - Tier 2 builds infrastructure for execution of activities at Tier 3.

3. Information System (Tier 3):
    - Conduct the day-to-day activities
    - Risk from an information system perspective
    - Ensure systems are secure, reliable, and available
    - Information System Tier is expressed as guides, plans, procedures, ... Scope is a system defined by security.


> For example,
> 
> a company may have identified that one of their biggest risks is
> the possibility of an employee stealing trade secrets or other confidential information (this corresponds to Tier 1 stage).
>
> To reduce this risk, they might implement policies
> that allow employees with access to such information to only use it for work purposes (this corresponds to Tier 2 stage).
>
> They may also make sure all employees have training on
> how to implement identity and access management (this corresponds to Tier 3 stage)

## Operational Risk Management (ORM)
ORM has three levels, four principles, and five steps

#### Three Levels of ORM
1. __Time-Critical__ ORM
    - On-the-run mental or oral review
    - Employed by experienced personnel in time-critical situations
    - Used when unusual situations occur in an otherwise routine operation
2. __Deliberate__ ORM
    - Applies entire process
    - Most effective in group setting
    - Used when applying general principles to specific situations
3. __In-Depth__ ORM
    - Develop general principles
    - Set policies
    - Applied to complex systems or operations

#### Four Principles of ORM:
ORM is guided by four principles:

1. Accept risk when benefits outweigh costs
2. Do NOT accept unnecessary risk
3. Anticipate and manage risk by planning
4. Make risk decisions at the right level

#### Five Steps of ORM:
```
Identify risk -> Assess risk -> Mitigation/Decision -> Implement controls -> Take corrective action/Monitor

```
