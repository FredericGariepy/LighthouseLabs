## GRC Workflow
Worflow:
1. Risk Assessment --> Produces: Prioritized risk List.
    1. Identification
    2. Analysis
    3. Evaluation
2. Risk Management --> Consumes RA List, produces RM mitigations.
    1. Risk Mitigation
    2. Risk Reporting and Monitoring
    3. Risk Governance
 
## Intro: Security Policies in GRC
Scope: Security policies in the context of governance, risk and compliance, or GRC

NIST, security policies define the objectives and constraints for the security program. 
> Policies are created at levels.

Lesson Goals:
- Relationship between GRC and the blue team operations
-  GRC, business and blue team impacts on organization's security processes
- ISO -v. NIST
- Stages of NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
- Use RMF to implement security control measures
- End activity Build a risk management plan for a specific scenario and communicate it to management-level audience.

## Cyber Security Risk Assessment 
Basics of Cyber Security Risk Assessment and Management.
- [What is GRC ?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/grc/#:%7E:text=help%20with%20GRC%3F-,What%20is%20GRC%3F,its%20technological%20innovation%20and%20adoption)
GRC = one coordinated model

GRC aligns IT with business goals, while managing risks and regulations.

Tools and processes unify risk management and governance.

Companies use GRC to achieve organizational goals reliably, remove uncertainty, and meet compliance requirements.

## GRC (3 parts)
#### Governance
Governance is the rules, processes, and policies that steer an organization and help it meet goals.

i.e. It is the set of policies, rules, or frameworks that a company uses to achieve its business goals.
 
Good governance includes the following:
- Ethics and accountability
- Transparent information sharing
- Conflict resolution policies
- Resource management


#### Risk
Risk refers to the more day-to-day, technical processes that are in place to mitigate and monitor risk.

e.i. Risk Management helps businesses identify different risks, including Cyber Security risks, and find ways to remediate any that are found.

Risk management
- Manage business: financial risk, legal risk, strategic risk, and security risks.
- Predict potential problems and minimize losses.

#### Compliance
Compliance is the steps a company takes to meet standards and regulations to run safely and legally.

i.e. Compliance is the act of following rules, laws, and regulations. It applies to legal and regulatory requirements set by industrial bodies and also for internal corporate policies

Compliance
- Following rules, laws, and regulations from several authority levels.
- Apply legal and regulatory requirements set by industrial bodies, internal corporate policies.


## Risk Assessment (RA)
Risk Assesments (RA) are used to build Indicent Response (IR)

Risk assements are used to create an inventory of all the potential threats.

Organizations can assess risk through a number of methods, such as:

- Assessing operational needs against known threats
- Conducting vulnerability assessments
- Measuring effectiveness of current policies and procedures
- Identifying changes in the business environment
- Evaluating third-party relationships

 __Assessment tools__ including: checklists, questionnaires, interviews, data analysis.

Risk Assessment has three key phases: 
1. Identification
    1. Identify assets: people, threats, process, existing controls, and vulnerabilities, technology.
2. Analysis
    1. Calculate risk from: [Impact and likelihood](#impact-and-likelyhood) of risk. Create prioritized risk list.(?)
3. Evaluation
    1. Compare calculated risk levels against risk evaluation and risk acceptance.
    > * wtf, why: "calculated risk levels against **risk evaluation**" ?
    2. Draft recommendations to mitigate risks for those controls failing to meet acceptance criteria.
    > * wtf, what: "for those controls failing" ?

## Cyber Security Risk Management (RM)
After completion of Risk Assessment process (Identification, Analysis, Evaluation),the next step is to manage the risk. 

Risk Management phases:
1. Risk Mitigation: Take generated ranked risk list (from RA), map mitigations to these threats, from greatest to the lowest.
> At some point in the list, the organization can pause mitigations effort on levels deemed not worth addressing.
>
> Some reasons: low likelihood, abundace of urgent and high impact threats to manage...

2. Risk Reporting and Monitoring: RMF requires to keep a list of known risks, and monitor known risks for compliance.
> Statistics on data breaches indicate that many companies still do not report all of the successful attacks they are exposed to, which could impact their peers.

Risk Governance:
3. Finally, all of the steps above should be codified into a risk governance system.

Risk : identified, assessed, and measured.
