#### Q. How does a Risk Assessment Checklist relate to an organizationâ€™s everyday operations?
A. Risk Assessment Checklist is tool, and relates to the organization's everyday operations in several ways:
1. Helps maintain _ongoing_ security awareness (__security posture checks__) and _ongoing_ compliance (__recurring audits__).
2. Supports compliance requirements by providing documentation of security efforts, good for third-party auditors.
3. Things change, assesments help to keep security measures up-to-date, prompts for updates when new systems or risks are discovered.
4. It's also an aid in identifying and mitigating risks that could impact daily operations.

#### Q. Who might be involved in completing a Risk Assessment Checklist?
A. Various stakeholders might be involved in completing a Risk Assessment Checklist, including:

1. IT and security teams
    - Asset inventory management, vulnerability assesment, testing mitigations
    - Asses system configurations, security controls
    - Indentify operational security gaps
3. Department managers / Senior management
    - [commissioning, organising and coordinating the assessment](https://oira.osha.europa.eu/en/roles-and-responsibilities)
    - Budget, allocate resource for assesment, oversee assessment, give tactical/strategic directions
5. Compliance officers
    - Assess internal/external policy compliance
    - Identify compliance gaps 
7. External auditors or consultants
    - neutral assesment of organization risk management
    - provide industry benchmarks, best practices, legal advice

#### Q. What kinds of things are looked into when completing a Risk Assessment Checklist?
A. When completing a Risk Assessment Checklist, a wide range of items are typically investigated:

- Assets: poeple, processes, physical assets, digital assets, information assets
- Access controls on assets and user privileges
- Incident response plans
- Security policies and procedures
- Employee training and awareness programs
- Compliance with external/internal regulations and standards
- Physical security measures
- Network and system configurations
- Data storage and protection methods
- Third-party risks and vendor management


#### Q. What may be the _Top five categories_ of things investigated as part of completing a Risk Assessment Checklist?
Based on the [14 families](https://github.com/FredericGariepy/LighthouseLabs/blob/main/PKM/W4/D4/InfoSec%20Risk%20Assessment.md#14-families-of-security-requirements-needed-to-address-nist-sp-800-171-checklist) of security requirement by NIST,

and __Assuming that the categorization step is completed__ (ie. accounting for assets, getting an up-to-date inventory) .

1. Risk Assessment (also called Risk Analysis)
A risk assessment is a key to the development and implementation of effective information security programs.
Assess the risks to your operations, including mission, functions, image, and reputation.
- Are you regularly testing your defenses in simulations?
- How regularly are you verifying operations and individuals for security purposes?

2. Media Protection
Ensure to protect, physically control, and securely store information system media that contain CUI, both paper and digital. Ensure store of backups securely. Ensure authorized personnel acccess only.

3. Access Controls: Ensuring proper user account management, least privilege principles, and separation of duties. Across both physical and digital assets.

4. [Incident Response](https://github.com/FredericGariepy/LighthouseLabs/blob/main/PKM/W4/D5/Project/reading/CISA%20Federal%20Government%20Cybersecurity%20Incident%20%26%20Vulnerability%20Response.md#incident-response): having a comprehensive incident plan in place with the 6 stages of IR, updated playbooks, workflows, processes.

5. Audit and Accountability
Keep system audit logs and records, that will allow you or your auditors to monitor, analyze, investigate and report any suspicious activity within your information systems. Ensure individual accessing and authorizing access can be held accountable.

> [!NOTE]
> Although here are listed the "top five" catergories, all 14 families of security requirements are needed.
