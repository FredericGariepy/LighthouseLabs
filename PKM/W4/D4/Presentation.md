#### Q. How does a Risk Assessment Checklist relate to an organizationâ€™s everyday operations?
A. Risk Assessment Checklist is tool, and relates to the organization's everyday operations in several ways:
1. Helps maintain _ongoing_ security awareness (__security posture checks__) and _ongoing_ compliance (__recurring audits__).
2. Supports compliance requirements by providing documentation of security efforts, good for third-party auditors.
3. Things change, assesments help to keep security measures up-to-date, prompts for updates when new systems or risks are discovered.
4. It's also an aid in identifying and mitigating risks that could impact daily operations.

#### Q. Who might be involved in completing a Risk Assessment Checklist?
A. Various stakeholders might be involved in completing a Risk Assessment Checklist, including:

1. IT and security teams
    - Asset inventory management, vulnerability assesment, testing mitigations
    - Asses system configurations, security controls
    - Indentify operational security gaps
3. Department managers / Senior management
    - [commissioning, organising and coordinating the assessment](https://oira.osha.europa.eu/en/roles-and-responsibilities)
    - Budget, allocate resource for assesment, oversee assessment, give tactical/strategic directions
5. Compliance officers
    - Assess internal/external policy compliance
    - Identify compliance gaps 
7. External auditors or consultants
    - neutral assesment of organization risk management
    - provide industry benchmarks, best practices, legal advice

#### Q. What kinds of things are looked into when completing a Risk Assessment Checklist?
A. When completing a Risk Assessment Checklist, a wide range of items are typically investigated:

- Assets: poeple, processes, physical assets, digital assets, information assets
- Access controls on assets and user privileges
- Incident response plans
- Security policies and procedures
- Employee training and awareness programs

Q. What are the __Top five categories__ of things investigated as part of completing a Risk Assessment Checklist?

Based on the [14 families](https://github.com/FredericGariepy/LighthouseLabs/blob/main/PKM/W4/D4/InfoSec%20Risk%20Assessment.md#14-families-of-security-requirements-needed-to-address-nist-sp-800-171-checklist) of security requirement by NIST, and assuming that the categorization step (ie. accounting for assets, getting an up-to-date inventory) is fundamental to the entire risk assesment process

1. Access Controls: Ensuring proper user account management, least privilege principles, and separation of duties.

3. Security Assessment: Periodically assessing the effectiveness of security controls and implementing continuous improvement plans.

4. Configuration Management: Documenting and monitoring network configurations, hardware, software, and firmware.

5. Incident Response: Ensuring a comprehensive plan is in place for preparation, threat detection, analysis, containment, and recovery.
