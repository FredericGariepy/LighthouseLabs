- [7 Cybersecurity Frameworks That Help Reduce Cyber Risk](https://www.bitsight.com/blog/7-cybersecurity-frameworks-to-reduce-cyber-risk)

## NIST 
### NIST SP 800-37 RMF consists of six steps:
1. Categorize information systems.
2. Select security controls.
3. Implement security controls.
4. Assess security controls.
5. Authorize information systems.
6. Monitor security controls.

## ISO
### ISO 27001 risk management process involves:
- Establishing the context: in this step, organizations identify the internal and external context in which they operate and the scope of the risk management process.
- Risk assessment: this step involves assessing the risks to the organization's information assets by considering the likelihood of a threat occurring and the impact it would have on the organization.
- Risk identification: in this step, organizations identify all potential risks to their information assets and systems, including threats, vulnerabilities, and possible impacts.
- Risk analysis: this step involves analyzing the identified risks to determine their causes, sources, and potential impacts on the organization.
- Risk evaluation: in this step, organizations evaluate and prioritize the identified risks based on their potential impacts and likelihood of occurrence.
- Risk treatment: this step involves selecting and implementing appropriate risk management strategies to address identified risks, such as implementing controls, transferring risk, or accepting risk.
