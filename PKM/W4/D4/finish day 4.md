Are you shoppig for a framework? \
You shouldn't get too hung up on Accronyms.

Risk management is three steps:
1.   Identify risks to the organizationâ€™s information 
2.   Implement controls appropriate to the risk
3.   Monitor their performance 

Got that? 3 steps. Risk managment, a.k.a. secure your shit framework. \
Don't follow an RMF that misses to cover your ends.

well then, you're in luck, this is the toyotathon of frameworks. \
And don't get your accronyms twisted! Dont confuse things like CSF with CSIRT. [Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT).](https://secureglobal.de/the-csirt-methodology)

First conider what the things you need in a framework:
- Suitability
- Feasibility
- Acceptability
- Explicitness
- Completeness
- Flexibility
- Scalability

Now here's the frameworks we've got here for you today \
Frameworks of focus for LHL:
- NIST SP 800-Series RMF
- ISO 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- NIST Security Frameworks (NIST RMF and NIST Cyber Security Framework [CSF]):

## NIST CSF 
Set of guidelines and best practices. (voluntary)
-  Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

## NIST RMF
A Comprehensive RMF that provides a structured process to manage risk. (mandatory for federal agencies.)
## ISO/IEC 27001
An information security management system (ISMS) \
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \
international standard framework for creating a comprehensive ISMS.
