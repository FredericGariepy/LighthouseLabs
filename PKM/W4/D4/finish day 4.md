Are you shoppig for a framework? \
You shouldn't get too hung up on Accronyms.

Risk management is three steps:
1.   Identify risks to the organization’s information 
2.   Implement controls appropriate to the risk
3.   Monitor their performance 

Got that? 3 steps. Risk managment, a.k.a. secure your shit framework. \
Don't follow an RMF that misses to cover your ends.

well then, you're in luck, this is the toyotathon of frameworks. \
And don't get your accronyms twisted! Dont confuse things like CSF with CSIRT. [Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT).](https://secureglobal.de/the-csirt-methodology)

First conider what the things you need in a framework:
- Suitability
- Feasibility
- Acceptability
- Explicitness
- Completeness
- Flexibility
- Scalability

Now here's the frameworks we've got here for you today \
Frameworks of focus for LHL:
- NIST SP 800-Series RMF
- ISO 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- NIST Security Frameworks (NIST RMF and NIST Cyber Security Framework [CSF]):

## NIST CSF 
Set of guidelines and best practices. (voluntary)
-  Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

## NIST RMF
A Comprehensive RMF that provides a structured process to manage risk. (mandatory for federal agencies.)
## ISO/IEC 27001
An information security management system (ISMS) \
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \
international standard framework for creating a comprehensive ISMS.


## NIST CSF :couple_with_heart: ISO 27001 - Complete me abby :people_hugging:
Completed your ISO 27001? you’ve achieved 60% of your NIST CSF. \
Instead, Complete NIST CSF and then you’re 78% of the way to the ISO 27001 finish line.

An important overlap area, in CSF and ISO 27001, is maintaining an asset register \
as recognized by Annex A.8.1 of ISO27001 for asset responsibility and ID.AM of NIST CSF for asset management.

### Diffrences :boxing_glove: NIST CSF -v. ISO 27001 :boom:
### CSF :baby: :older_man: ISO
The ISO 27001 offers a good certification choice for organizations that have operational maturity \
while the NIST CSF may be best suited for organizations that are in the initial stages of developing a cybersecurity risk program or attempting to mitigate breaches.

### CSF :free: :moneybag: ISO
NIST CSF is available free, ISO 27001 involves audits and certification, Cert valid for three years, surveillance audits for two years and in year three, they’ll complete a recertification audit. 

So start-ups will usually kick start their InfoSec program with NIST and work their way up to ISO 27001 as they scale.
