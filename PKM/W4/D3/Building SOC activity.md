## Activity Guidelines: 
In this assignment, we ask you to build an SOC structure to the extent that it allows for the construction of Workflows. This entails enough descriptive content and knowledge of the roles and responsibilities within the SOC that opening, escalating, and closing of tickets can be managed.

Keep in mind all the roles that exist in a typical SOC and ensure that you have detailed the responsibility of each person. As a test, pass a fictional ticket through the workflow, making sure that it has an opening, work, escalation, closing, and reporting attached to it. Remember, this is a group assignment, therefore discuss the structure with your team, assign roles in the team, and see if the structure works. 

Instructions

Follow the instructions given below to create an SOC workflow for Ransomware:

1. Create an SOC structure that can adequately handle Ransomware.
2. Use the information found in the [Ransomware playbook](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/ransomware-playbook-itsm00099).
3. Use all the information provided to create your own Ransomware Workflow for your organization.
> This will become your Ransomware Playbook (a playbook is a workflow assigned to a specific task.
>
> Remember, in this case, the playbook should cover all the phases of an incident response plan, which commonly include:
>
> Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.

4. As a reminder of the phases, read [6 Phases in the Incident Response Plan](https://www.securitymetrics.com/blog/6-phases-incident-response-plan).
5. Make sure that your structure is detailed enough that all incidents can be handled and that accurate workflows can be constructed for day-to-day operations, as well as to handle this specific workflow.

By the end of this exercise, you should have created the following assets:
- Flow charts and documentation to depict the SOC workflows
- Ransomware workflow (playbook) for your SOC
- A slideshow to present your findings

## Quetions/Steps in playbook creation
From [Laura Franks](https://github.com/ldfranks): Week 4 day 4: Part 2 Lecture: Understanding Playbooks

When creating a playbook, we consider the following:
1. Define the Objectives and Scope:
- Clearly state the objectives of the playbook.
- Specify the scope, including the types of data breaches it covers (e.g., unauthorized
access, data exfiltration, insider threats).
2. Identify the Incident Response Team:
- List the members of the incident response team and their roles.
-  Ensure clear lines of communication and reporting.
3. Risk Assessment:
- Assess the potential impact of a data breach on your organization.
- Identify critical assets and data
4. Incident Classification:
- Define different levels of incidents based on severity and impact.


5. Detection and Notification:
- Specify how data breaches will be detected.
- Define notification procedures, including legal requirements (e.g., GDPR in
Europe, various data breach notification laws in different Canadian provinces).
6. Containment and Eradication:
- Describe steps to contain the breach to prevent further damage.
- Develop procedures for identifying and removing the root cause.
7. Investigation and Forensics:
- Outline the process for investigating the breach.
- Preserve evidence for potential legal actions.
8. Communication:
- Define internal and external communication plans.
- Specify how to communicate with affected parties and stakeholders

9. Legal and Regulatory Compliance:
- Ensure compliance with data protection and privacy regulations.
- Consult with legal counsel as needed.
10. Recovery and Remediation:
- Detail the steps to restore systems and data to normal operation.
- Implement security improvements to prevent future breaches.
11. Documentation:
- Maintain detailed records of all actions taken during the incident response.
12. Testing and Training:
- Regularly test the playbook through simulated exercises.
- Provide ongoing training to the incident response team.
13. Post-Incident Review:
- After each incident, conduct a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement in the playbook and response process.
14. Updates and Maintenance:
- Keep the playbook up to date to reflect changes in technology, threats, and regulations.
15. Public Relations (if applicable):
- If the breach is public, have a strategy for managing public relations and protecting your organization's reputation

The incident response phases are:

    Preparation
    Identification
    Containment
    Eradication
    Recovery
    Lessons Learned

1. Preparation
- Ensure your employees are properly trained regarding their incident response roles and responsibilities in the event of data breach
- Develop incident response drill scenarios and regularly conduct mock data breaches to evaluate your incident response plan.
- Ensure that all aspects of your incident response plan (training, execution, hardware and software resources, etc.) are approved and funded in advance


2. Identification

ASK: When, What, Where, Who, Why, How.

3. Containment
- Don't delete evidence.
- Disconnect
- Have backups / redundant systems
- update and patch your systems
- review your remote access protocols / user permisions

4. Eradication
- removal of malware
- harden/patch/update
- be thourough

5. Recovery
-restoring and returning affected systems and devices back into your business environment

6. Lessons Learned
- Post mortem
- Update knowledge base
- Evaluate response plan
