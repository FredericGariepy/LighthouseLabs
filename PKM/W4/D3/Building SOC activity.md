## Activity Guidelines:
: diferent levels of roles that might exist in an SOC.

In this assignment, we ask you to build an SOC structure to the extent that it allows for the construction of Workflows. This entails enough descriptive content and knowledge of the roles and responsibilities within the SOC that opening, escalating, and closing of tickets can be managed.

Keep in mind all the roles that exist in a typical SOC and ensure that you have detailed the responsibility of each person. As a test, pass a fictional ticket through the workflow, making sure that it has an opening, work, escalation, closing, and reporting attached to it. Remember, this is a group assignment, therefore discuss the structure with your team, assign roles in the team, and see if the structure works.
