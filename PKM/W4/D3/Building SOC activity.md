## Activity Guidelines: 
In this assignment, we ask you to build an SOC structure to the extent that it allows for the construction of Workflows. This entails enough descriptive content and knowledge of the roles and responsibilities within the SOC that opening, escalating, and closing of tickets can be managed.

Keep in mind all the roles that exist in a typical SOC and ensure that you have detailed the responsibility of each person. As a test, pass a fictional ticket through the workflow, making sure that it has an opening, work, escalation, closing, and reporting attached to it. Remember, this is a group assignment, therefore discuss the structure with your team, assign roles in the team, and see if the structure works. 

Instructions

Follow the instructions given below to create an SOC workflow for Ransomware:

1. Create an SOC structure that can adequately handle Ransomware.
2. Use the information found in the [Ransomware playbook](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/ransomware-playbook-itsm00099).
3. Use all the information provided to create your own Ransomware Workflow for your organization.
> This will become your Ransomware Playbook (a playbook is a workflow assigned to a specific task.
>
> Remember, in this case, the playbook should cover all the phases of an incident response plan, which commonly include:
>
> Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.

4. As a reminder of the phases, read [6 Phases in the Incident Response Plan](https://www.securitymetrics.com/blog/6-phases-incident-response-plan).
5. Make sure that your structure is detailed enough that all incidents can be handled and that accurate workflows can be constructed for day-to-day operations, as well as to handle this specific workflow.

By the end of this exercise, you should have created the following assets:
- Flow charts and documentation to depict the SOC workflows
- Ransomware workflow (playbook) for your SOC
- A slideshow to present your findings
