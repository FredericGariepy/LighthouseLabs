## SOC Responsibility
SOC teams must fulfill a number of responsibilities to effectively manage security incidents, (Investigate, Triage, Coordinate):
- _Investigating_ Potential Incidents: SOC teams receive a large number of alerts, determine if it is a real attack or a false positive.
- _Triaging_ and Prioritizing Detected Incidents: Limited incident response resources. Once incident is identified, needs triage and prioritized to optimize resource utilization and minimize enterprise risk.
- _Coordinating_ an Incident Response: Responding requires multiple stakeholders and use of different tools. SOC analysts must orchestrate for timely and complete remediation.

## SOC Other responsibilities
Role of the SOC is not limited to incident response. Other roles & responsibilities include:
- __Stay Relevant__:
> The cyber threat landscape is evolving, SOC teams need to manage the latest threats to the organization. Keep-up with new/trending attacks. Update Security systems to detect such attacks.
- __Patching__ Vulnerable Systems:
> Identifying, applying, and testing patches for vulnerable enterprise systems and software.
- __Infrastructure Management__:
> Changes in cyber threat landscape & enterprise network require new security solutions. SOC teams are responsible for identifying, deploying, configuring, and managing their security infrastructure.
- Addressing Support __Tickets__:
> Many SOC teams are part of the IT department. This means that SOC analysts may be called upon to address support tickets from an organizations’ employees.
- __Reporting__ to Management:
> Security is part of the business, SOC teams report to management. Need to effectively communicate security costs and ROI to business audience.

## Common SOC Challenges
Most common challenges that SOC teams face in fulfilling their roles include:
- __Staffing Critical Roles__: The cybersecurity industry is experiencing a significant skills gap. This makes it difficult for organizations to attract and retain the talent required to protect themselves against cyber threats.
- Weeding Out __False Positives__: The average SOC receives tens of thousands of alerts each day, but only a small fraction are from real threats. SOC analysts must identify the needles in a large haystack of logs and alerts, which consumes valuable time and resources.
- __Minimizing Operational Impacts__: Not everything suspicious within an organization’s network is malicious and part of a real attack. SOCs must expose and shut down only real attacks, while allowing legitimate business to continue.
- __Rapidly Responding to Attacks__: The longer an attacker has access to an organization’s network, the greater the cost and damage to the organization. SOC teams must rapidly identify and remediate attacks to minimize the impact on the company.
- __Collecting and Aggregating Data__: Many organizations have an array of point security solutions. The resulting incomplete and disconnected network visibility impairs effective incident detection and response.



## SOC Roles


#### SOC Analyst

The analysts are responsible for monitoring security alerts, analyzing security incidents, and responding quickly to potential threats. They use various tools and technologies to investigate alerts, determine their validity, and escalate incidents that require further attention.

#### Incident Responder

They are essential in developing and implementing incident response plans, coordinating with other teams, and ensuring a fast and effective response to security breaches. They are also responsible for incident investigations and writing reports of related incidents.

#### Threat Hunter

They use advanced techniques and tools to detect threats that may not be identified by automated systems. This helps the SOC to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats and improve the overall security posture of the organization.

#### Forensic Analyst

The forensic analyst collects all physical and digital evidence from the crime scene that can be used to solve the case in the future. The accumulated data can be analyzed with special software. The goal is to write a report that will help solve the case with this evidence.

#### Security Engineer

They ensure that security tools are properly configured, up to date, and effectively integrated with the organization's infrastructure. They also work with other IT teams to implement security best practices. Their primary responsibility is to define and implement the organization's security policies and procedures.

#### SOC Manager

The SOC Manager is responsible for leading the SOC and overseeing its overall operation. Their role includes strategic planning, coordination, and ensuring that the team is aligned with the organization's security objectives
