After escalating a ticket to an appropriate SOC team member,
the Intake Analyst must create shift-end reports\
at the end of the shift and then handover to the incoming shift member.

#### SWAP
Situation, Written, Accurate, Persistence\
__Staff__\
- When is the handoff scheduled?
First, shift-takers need to be there. Possible for incoming staff member to be late. \
__Prioritization__ is key here. Prioritizing all active incidents and activities, therefore talking about the most pressing concerns first.\
__Situational Awareness__ identify potential, upcoming issues before they become problems, and actively taking care of them early.\
This an be infrastructure needs: updates, configuration adjustment needs, and hardware or software problems, among other things\
This can be practicing good active threat intelligence research, actively planning, implementing mitigations.\
__Transition__ consistency. Use automation of shift-end tasks and handoff duties/activities to help promote and maintain effective shift-end handoff procedures.\
