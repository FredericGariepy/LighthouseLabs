Introduction

In this case study, you will review and prioritize the devices and services that Bulldog Excavations has in its setup. You will then decide on and make recommendations on what logs should be collected, what network traffic should be captured, and what metadata would be important to capture.
Bulldog Excavations Case Study

Cat has been hired by Bulldog Excavations to audit their security setup and make recommendations for improving it. Cat recognizes how important monitoring is to an effective security posture and has asked for your input to help her decide on recommendations for data monitoring for Bulldog Excavations infrastructure.

You will also recommend how to set up storage of any data that is captured and what considerations should be taken into account when deciding on how long the data should be kept.
Bulldog Excavations Infrastructure

One Windows Server that hosts a file share, a small database, and an Active Directory domain structure for the business.
Website is hosted offsite, but they monitor and use the analytics data to help them make business decisions.
Email and personal file storage is maintained through an online service.
There are eight Windows Workstations in the company:
One is used as a payment system which sends transaction data to another one that is an office/accounting machine where all financial management and records are kept.
The other six workstations are used for project/contract planning and tracking.
There is a main switch and router to manage the internal network devices as well as a dedicated firewall device at the edge of the network.

Instruction

Review the four tasks below and make decisions and recommendations for each of them:

Prioritize the various devices, services, and data types within the business by importance to the business functionality.
What types of data should be collected from the various devices in the Bulldog Excavations infrastructure, and prioritize them by importance.
Recommend where and how each type of data that is collected and maintained should be stored and explain your decisions.
Suggest criteria that should be considered when Cat and Bulldog Excavations decide how long each type of collected data should be kept.

Note

Make recommendations on what logs should be collected, what network traffic should be captured, and what metadata would be important to capture.
Instructions for your Recommendations Document

Organize your decisions and recommendations into a paper that includes:

An introduction and a summary
A short slideshow presentation with presenter notes that summarizes your recommendations that Cat can use to present to the Bulldog Excavations executives

Once completed, post your document and slides to Discord inviting your peers to provide feedback.
