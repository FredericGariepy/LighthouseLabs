# Malware Analysis Stages
0. __Static properties analysis__: \
Collecting, recording standard details to help identify the malware without running it. It can include collecting: file names, sizes, hashes, file type, header details, metadata content, and any retrievable strings of understandable information found in the malware code. 
1. __Interactive behaviour analysis__:
- dynamic analysis: executing the malware in a controlled environment.
- Executed in virtual machine, sandbox

collecting information about how the malware behaved in a lab environment.
sophisticated malware will determine what type of production environment it’s in \
It may adjust its behaviour accordingly, or possibly, not actually run.
3. __Fully automated analysis__:
4. __Manual code reversing__: \
Requires a very high level of skil. Decompiled machine code.

### Benefits
1. Incident Response: How much damage, what needs fixing, what needs cleaning.
2. Who did it: Identify security gaps, people, policy, tech, all that needs fix.
3. Attacker sophistication: malware complexity, targets, behaviours...
4. Identify Vulnerability: What securty gap to mitigate. 

## Malware Detection

#### Signature-Based or Pattern Matching:
A signature is an algorithm or hash (a number derived from a string of text) that uniquely identifies a specific virus.

#### Heuristic Analysis or Pro-Active Defense:
Heuristic scanning looks for certain instructions or commands within a program that are not found in typical application programs.

#### Rule Based:
The component of the heuristic engine that conducts the analysis (the analyzer) extracts certain rules from a file and this rules will be compared against a set of rules for malicious code.

#### Behavioral Blocking:
The suspicious behavior approach, by contrast, does not attempt to identify known viruses, but instead monitors the behavior of all programs.

#### Weight-Based ( old styled ):
Rates each functionality it detects with a certain weight according to the degree of danger

#### Sandbox:
Allows the file to run in a controlled virtual system (or“sandbox”) to see what it does.
