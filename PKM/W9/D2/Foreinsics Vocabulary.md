- Disk Cloning or Imaging
Developing sector-by-sector copy of a disk followed by the compression of these images in the form of a file. The captured image can be stored on any other divergent media or device and can be restored later as per need at any point of investigation. \

### E01
The E01 (Encase Image File Format) file keeps a backup of various types of acquired digital evidence that includes disk imaging, storing of logical files, etc. When an investigator (or a Forensic Expert) uses Encase to create a backup of data available in the hard disk, a physical bit stream of the data is produced. This procedure is known as Disk Imaging. \

### pagefile 
In storage, a pagefile is a reserved portion of a storage drive that is used as an extension of random access memory for data in RAM that hasn't been used recently. A pagefile can be read from the storage drive as one contiguous chunk of data and thus faster than re-reading data from various original locations. \
Windows uses pagefiles to make more RAM available to applications that are used actively, rather than sitting idle. \
