### Autoruns
Autoruns is a Microsoft tool that identifies software configured to run when a device is booted, or a user logs into their account. \
Legitimate software will often launch when a machine is powered on. \

### pagefile 
In storage, a pagefile is a reserved portion of a storage drive that is used as an extension of random access memory for data in RAM that hasn't been used recently. A pagefile can be read from the storage drive as one contiguous chunk of data and thus faster than re-reading data from various original locations. \
Windows uses pagefiles to make more RAM available to applications that are used actively, rather than sitting idle. \
