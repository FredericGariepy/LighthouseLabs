### 1. Executive Summary
The executive summary should include:
-    The date(s), purpose, and scope of tests that were run.
-   The status of the assessment.
-   A brief summary of the findings.
-   A short overview of what is recommended.

### 2. Scan Results
how you are categorizing the results found from scan.

The scan results section will include:
- Definitions of the various severity levels used to describe vulnerabilities that were found.-
- How the recommendations are organized.
- An overview of the types of reports and results that will be found in the rest of the report.

### 3. Methodology
A report methodology section should include:
- What tools and tests were used to complete the vulnerability scanning.
- The specific purpose of each tool, test, and scan that was completed.
- The environments in which each test was run.

### 4. Findings
Your findings section will describe:
- What was scanned.
- What was not scanned.
- Explanations for any scans that were supposed to be included, but were not completed.

### 5. Risk Assessment
catalogues and categorizes the vulnerabilities found, relevant severity. \
categorize each vulnerability according to its severity level: Critical, High, Medium, or Low. \
This will be followed by an extended section listing each vulnerability and giving details about it. \
Details given for each vulnerability should include:
- Name of the vulnerability.
- Date of its discovery.
- Score based on CVE and CVSS.
- Detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Detailed description of the affected systems.
- Details of the process to correct the vulnerability.

Note

They want to understand the information quickly.

Use predictive format

You may find that a table format makes the most sense for parts of this section.

#### 6. Recommendations

determine the impact of your assessment and the next steps needed.

summary of the most critical things that your team feels require attention:
-    The order they should be addressed in.
-   What steps should be taken in each case.
-  The effect on the network's security posture.
- Any recommended security policy or configuration adjustments.

What critical takeaways do you want to make absolutely sure they read?
- Do not assume that your readers are technically trained.
- include explanations of any technical information or processes that non-technically trained readers will be able to understand.
- Get information across as quickly and as simply as possible: use direct, clear, and short sentences.

Cost/Benefit: \  
the cost of fixing the problem,  cost of not fixing it.
 
clear and actionable recommendations: \
 measurable actions to implement effectively with clear reasons
