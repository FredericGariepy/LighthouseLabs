# Risk Management Case Study
Risk management plan has met the technical, security, and user requirements within the user scenario.

Project Description
> The purpose of __Risk Management__ is to _systematically find out which incidents can happen_ to an organization.
> _Apply the process of_ __Risk Treatment__ to minimize the damage of such incidents in an organization.

> Executive Summary


# Executive Summary
Report is an Executive Summary that captures risk management process.
- Executive summary that gives _insight_ into the case
- Risk Assessment and Identification
- Recommendations for Risk Treatment.
- Executive Summary in the business language

This document was produced by assessing the [case information](https://github.com/FredericGariepy/LighthouseLabs/edit/main/PKM/W5/Projects/Risk%20Management/case%20info.md), [organization struture](https://github.com/FredericGariepy/LighthouseLabs/tree/main/PKM/W5/Projects/Risk%20Management/Employees) and [organization assets](https://github.com/FredericGariepy/LighthouseLabs/blob/main/PKM/W5/Projects/Risk%20Management/Assets/tangibles.md) to fill the basics in the [risk __assesment__ and __treatment__ table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tdwJMT4QcLoH7Z3jlgjyE5qsRtAtCaPpqXVqKaXtYuU/edit?usp=sharing).

The Report is not complete, as it focuses on <number> of main threats, and provides the workflow to complete the report. \
Follow  this documen to read about the reccomned treatmens of main threats. \ 
To further bring this report into compliance with ISO 27001 see the recomendations at the end.




__Include the following components:__

# 0. Purpose, scope, and users


> Risk __Assessment__ and Risk __Treatment__ Methodology:
# 1. Risk Assessment:

- [Inventory. Risk & Treatment Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tdwJMT4QcLoH7Z3jlgjyE5qsRtAtCaPpqXVqKaXtYuU/edit?usp=sharing)

> - The process: Explain what process you might follow. List 3 or more individuals or groups you might involve & why.

> - Assets, vulnerabilities, and threats: Based on the information provided by DE, list the 3 main threats you expect DE to face and the challenges you expect them to face while managing these threats; reflect back on vulnerabilities and threats.

- Determining the risk owners: In examination of three different risks, create a “chain” of ownership of the risk from ground level to senior executive level. Explain what and how each owner may contribute to the chain.
- Impact and likelihood: Create a table that lists three threats or risks. Reflect and document the effect of these risks on C, I, or A or more than one of these, to what extent (from 0 to 10) and how likely (0 to 5)?
- Risk acceptance criteria: Explain how the most likely / highest risk item may impact DE and explain why some items in the table may be “ignored” or “minimized” based on the information provided by DE – reflect back on your risk assignments.
2. Risk Treatment:
- Summarize the 3 main threats you have identified
- Recommended mitigations or responses you recommend for each
- Priority you would give each threat.
    - Be sure to explain your prioritizations and your recommended responses.
