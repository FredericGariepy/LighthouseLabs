The following are two activities; unsolicited penetration testing, spam, \
where applicable laws were intresting to me.

## Unsolicited penetration testing
i.e. the exploitation of an IT system without the permission of its owner to determine its vulnerabilities and weak points. \
Unsolicited penetration testing may be considered an offence under Section 342.1 of the Criminal Code. \
Under Section 342.1, individuals are prohibited from fraudulently,

and ___without_ colour of right__, \

obtaining, directly or indirectly, any computer service, or intercepting or causing to be intercepted, directly or indirectly, any function of a computer system. \
Unsolicited penetration testing may also be considered mischief under Section 430(1.1) of the Criminal Code, as detailed above.

#### New phrase of the day "Colour of right".
###### 10 points if you know the meaning.
Answer: \
"An excuse or defense for certain offences."

e.g. \
Actions were driven by a desire to help improve security rather than to exploit vulnerabilities. \
Show Non-disclosure of vulnerabilities, No harm done, Confusion of legal Boundaries.

## SPAM!
While not a criminal offence, \
Canada’s anti-spam legislation (“CASL”), \
prohibits the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages (“CEMs”).

Under section 20(4) of CASL, any person who contravenes CASL may be subject to a maximum administrative monetary penalty \
of up to $1 million in the case of an individual, \
and up to $10 million in the case of any other person.
