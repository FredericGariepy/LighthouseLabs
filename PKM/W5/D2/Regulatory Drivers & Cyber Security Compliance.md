> The reality of the situation is your company invests in cybersecurity and privacy as a necessity.
> This necessity is driven in large part by laws, regulations and contractual requirements that it is legally-obligated to comply with.
>  It is also driven by the desire to protect its public image from damaging acts that happen when cybersecurity and privacy practices are ignored.

- GRC is akin to the brakes on your car, where they enable a business’ operations to go fast and avoid catastrophic accidents.
- understanding and clarifying the difference between "compliant" versus "secure" enhances risk management discussions.

##### GRC Is A Puzzle So Please Be Part of The Solution
_Ask yourself one question_: \
If there was a major data breach today and all eyes focused on your company, when the dust settles and root causes are investigated, would your company’s leadership and its technology stakeholders be considered negligent for failing to implement “reasonable” security and privacy practices? \
__Now__, as a GRC professional, look at your specific role and the responsibilities you have for helping keep data and technology secure. \
Are you part of the solution or the problem?
