provisions and regulations may be either mandatory or recommended. \
Failure to comply with these regulations may result in criminal prosecution, civil liability, or loss of confidence

The information must be protected, whether stored, processed, integrated, or transferred. Standards vary.

The following types of data and information are subject to Cyber Security compliance:

- Personally identifiable information (PII): date of birth, first/last names, address, social security number (SSN), etc.
- Financial information: credit card numbers, expiration dates and card verification values (CVV), bank account information, debit or credit card personal identification numbers (PINs), etc.
- Protected health information: medical history, insurance records, prescription records, etc.

#### Integrated Controls Management (ICM)
- [Practical Guidance To Implement GRC](https://complianceforge.com/governance-risk-compliance-grc/)
- The terms GRC = IRM . They are Synonymous.

##### picture below:  controls are central in ICM

> The reality of the situation is your company invests in cybersecurity and privacy as a necessity.
> This necessity is driven in large part by laws, regulations and contractual requirements that it is legally-obligated to comply with.
>  It is also driven by the desire to protect its public image from damaging acts that happen when cybersecurity and privacy practices are ignored.

- GRC is akin to the brakes on your car, where they enable a business’ operations to go fast and avoid catastrophic accidents.
- understanding and clarifying the difference between "compliant" versus "secure" enhances risk management discussions.

##### GRC Is A Puzzle So Please Be Part of The Solution
_Ask yourself one question_: \
If there was a major data breach today and all eyes focused on your company, when the dust settles and root causes are investigated, would your company’s leadership and its technology stakeholders be considered negligent for failing to implement “reasonable” security and privacy practices? \
__Now__, as a GRC professional, look at your specific role and the responsibilities you have for helping keep data and technology secure. \
Are you part of the solution or the problem?


# GRC Is a Plan, Do, Check & Act (PDCA) Adventure 
#### 1. Plan.
> The overall GRC process beings with planning. This planning will define the policies, standards and controls for the organization. It will also directly influence the tools and services that an organization purchases, since technology purchases should address needs that are defined by policies and standards.
#### 2. Do.
> Arguably, this is the most important section for cybersecurity and privacy practitioners. Controls are the “security glue” that make processes, applications, systems and services secure. Procedures (also referred to as control activities) are the processes how the controls are actually implemented and performed. The Secure Controls Framework (SCF) can be an excellent starting point for a control set if your organization lacks a comprehensive set of cybersecurity and privacy controls.
#### 3. Check.
> In simple terms, this is situational awareness. Situational awareness is only achieved through reporting through metrics and reviewing the results of audits/assessment.
#### 4. Act.
> This is essentially risk management, which is an encompassing area that deals with addressing two main concepts (1) real deficiencies that currently exist and (2) possible threats to the organization.


## ICM "compliant" versus "secure"
ICM specifically focuses on the need to understand and clarify the difference between "compliant" versus "secure" \
__Unlike GRC/IRM__

ICM categorize its applicable controls according to “must have” vs “nice to have”.

### Integrated Controls Management Principles
#### There are eight (8) principles associated with ICM:

1. **Establish Context**
   > Multi-Tiered Risk Management Strategy. Ask: 5W1H.
<img src="https://content.complianceforge.com/graphics/c-scrm-cybersecurity-supply-chain-risk-management.jpg" alt="Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management" width="600" height="auto">

2. **Define Applicable Controls**
   > Tailor controls to meet both compliance (MCR) and security needs (DSR).

3. **Assign Maturity-Based Criteria**
   > Tailored maturity level criteria can be used to plan for, budget for and assess against.

4. **Publish Policies, Standards & Procedures**
   > Documentation must exist, else controls are unenforceable.

5. **Assign Stakeholder Accountability**
   > Ensure clear ownership and responsibility for controls.

6. **Maintain Situational Awareness**
   > Monitor and analyze metrics for informed decision-making. Adjust plans to operate within the organization’s risk threshold.

7. **Manage Risk**
   > Proactive. RM must exist throughout the SDLC. Identify and mitigate risks to securit.

8. **Evolve Processes**
   > Adapt PDCA/Deming Cycle to meet evolving threat landscape. IR plans.

# GRC Order
1) compliance influences (2) governance, which influences (3) risk management.
1. compliance
2. governance
3. risk management
    - Reduce the risk to an acceptable level;
    - Avoid the risk;
    - Transfer the risk to another party; or
    - Accept the risk.
# If GRC Is Not Documented, It Doesn’t Exist 


# Garbage In = Garbage Out (GIGO)
You cannot reasonably expect a GRC solution to dictate what your processes are going to be.

There are tools that exist to automate your existing processes, but if you have bad processes today, automating that will only makes those bad practices faster.

This is the “garbage in = garbage out” issue that plagues many GRC implementations.

__GIGO is especially true with Risk Management.__ \
Using COTS risk management tools; risk catalog in COTS tools often have little to no tie-in to the organization’s actual cybersecurity and privacy controls, let alone its policies and standards.
> This often leads to Risk Management teams "going rogue" making up their own risks that have no legitimate tie in - it just looks impressive and analysts are kept busy
