## four(4) key categories: software, network, hardware, and people
#### software
Vulnerabilities:
 -   Software or hardware misconfiguration
-    Poor development methods
#### Network Vulnerabilities
-    Network misconfigurations
-    Old, out of date, or unsupported network hardware and OSs
#### Hardware Vulnerabilities
-    Continued use of unsupported items (as with the network area)
-    Use of items that are inherently insecure (e.g., IoT devices) or not updated regularly
#### People
- human error
-  poor training
- social engineering


## Top 7 threats 
[CrowdStrike Falcon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/exposure-management/falcon-spotlight-vulnerability-management/)
1. Misconfigurations
> Misconfigurations are the single largest threat to both cloud and app security
2.  Unsecured APIs
> APIs are one of the few organizational assets with a public IP address
3. Outdated or Unpatched Software
> Unpatched or outdated software often make for an easy target for advanced cybercriminals
4. Zero-day Vulnerabilities
>  vendor was unaware of their software vulnerability. Next-gen antivirus (NGAV), endpoint detection and response (EDR) and threat intelligence.
5. Weak or Stolen User Credentials
> Weak user credentials are most often exploited in brute force attacks. Use MFA, and a fingerprint or a password and a one-time security token, to authenticate the user.
6. Access Control or Unauthorized Access
> implement the principle of least privilege (POLP)
7. Misunderstanding the “Shared Responsibility Model” (i.e., Runtime Threats)
> Cloud networks adhere to shared responsibility model. This means that much of the underlying infrastructure is secured by the cloud service provider.
> However, the organization is responsible for everything else, including the operating system, applications and data.
>
> Unfortunately, this point can be misunderstood.
