## four(4) key categories: software, network, hardware, and people


#### software
Vulnerabilities:
 -   Software or hardware misconfiguration
-    Poor development methods
#### Network Vulnerabilities
-    Network misconfigurations
-    Old, out of date, or unsupported network hardware and OSs
#### Hardware Vulnerabilities
-    Continued use of unsupported items (as with the network area)
-    Use of items that are inherently insecure (e.g., IoT devices) or not updated regularly

#### People
- human error
-  poor training
- social engineering
