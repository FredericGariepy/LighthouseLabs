In practice, [IR](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_1/home?element=IR) (incident response), is a neglected area. As it does not give immediate benefits (unlike immediate access controls benefits, like: MFA, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT, SESSION TERMINATION, REMOTE ACCESS , LEAST PRIVILEGE, etc...)

### Access controls without documentation do not exist
'RBAC' Role based access control. define roles clearly.

### Cloud access control implemetation
- Mulit cloud scenario (No locked in to one provider)
- Provided cloud responsibility model  [Azure shared responsibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility) [AWS Shared Responsibility Mode](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)
