##### What is Residual Risk?
Residual risk is the level of risk that remains after controls have been put in place to mitigate initial risks.


### Benefits of Residual Risk Analysis

- **Improved Risk Management:**
  - Residual risk analysis helps organizations understand the level of risk that remains after implementing controls.
  - This information can be used to prioritize risk management activities and allocate resources more effectively.

- **Better Decision Making:**
  - Provides a clearer understanding of the risk landscape.
  - Allows organizations to make more informed decisions about risk management strategies and allocate resources where they are needed most.

- **Compliance:**
  - Many industries and regulations require organizations to assess and manage risk.
  - Helps organizations meet these requirements and demonstrate their commitment to managing risk effectively.

- **Continual Improvement:**
  - Regularly reviewing and updating residual risk analysis helps identify areas for improvement.
  - Enables organizations to make changes to their risk management processes over time.

### How is Residual Risk Estimated?

A residual risk template, or the residual risk section of the Risk Assessment Table, is a tool used to identify and assess the risks that remain after controls have been put in place to mitigate initial risks. To complete a residual risk template, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Initial Risks:**
   - Review previous Risk Assessments or conduct a new Risk Assessment to identify all potential risks.

2. **Evaluate the Effectiveness of Existing Controls:**
   - Determine if the existing controls are effectively mitigating the initial risks and assess whether they can be improved.

3. **Assess Residual Risk:**
   - Based on the effectiveness of existing controls, assess the residual risk for each initial risk.
   - Determine the likelihood and impact of the residual risk and assign a residual risk rating.

4. **Develop Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
   - Identify and prioritize mitigation strategies for the residual risks.

5. **Implement Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
   - Put in place the risk mitigation strategies that have been identified and prioritized.

6. **Review and Update the Residual Risk Template:**
   - Regularly review and update the residual risk template to ensure that it remains relevant and accurate.
