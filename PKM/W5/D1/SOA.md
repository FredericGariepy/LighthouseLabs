# Writing Statement of Applicability (SOA)

## ISO 27001 SOA: What Is It?
ISO 27001: This is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS).

Annex A: This is a key part of ISO 27001. It contains a list of controls (security measures)

Statement of Applicability (SOA): The SOA is a crucial document that organizations must create as part of their ISMS. It lists all the controls from Annex A and specifies which ones are applicable to the organization.

For each control, the SOA should detail:
- Whether the control is implemented or not.
- How it is implemented (if it is).
- The justification(rational) for its inclusion or exclusion.


# How to Write an ISO 27001 SOA?  (6 steps)
## 1. _Recognize_ and _Assess_ Threats to Your ISMS
List all of your information assets \
and the potential data security risks associated with each one, as part of an ISO 27001 Risk Assessment.

> Following this, you may assign a risk owner, develop a strategy to address any vulnerabilities, and rank and prioritize risks based on their probability and effect. This document serves as a template for conducting a risk analysis in accordance with ISO 27001.

## 2. Define Your Risk Management Strategy
SO 27001 specifies four (4) __methods__ for _handling potential dangers_:
- __Mitigate__
> take precautions to lessen the possibility that it will really happen.
- __Avoid__
> eliminate the potential for harm by putting an end to the underlying conditions that might bring about an adverse outcome.
- __Transfer__
> outsource the danger to someone else (i.e., outsource security efforts to another company, purchase insurance, etc.)
- __Accept__
> if the possible loss is less than the expense of preventing the risk, you should take it.

Risk Treatment plan
> After compiling a list of potential threats, you must now choose how to address each one. A Risk Treatment plan is a document that specifies the risks that need to be addressed, who is responsible for them, how they will be addressed (mitigate, avoid, transfer, accept), and when they will be addressed.

## 3. Settle on the Preventative Measures in Terms of Security
_Chose_ __controls to mitigate__.
> After you've zeroed in on the threats you wish to eliminate (mitigate), \
you may choose the controls that will have the most effect. Review the controls suggested in Annex A and ISO 27002 to figure out which ones will work best for your business.

> E.g.
>
> Weak or shared passwords between workers, for instance, pose a threat to data security. Implementing a company-wide password management system, such as Password, is one feasible control.

## 4. Make a Tally of the Controls you Won't be Utilizing and the Reasons Why
In the (ISO 27001) Risk Treatment strategy, document any hazards that you have decided to ignore.
> Accepting a risk might be more cost-effective in the long run for a firm than attempting to mitigate it. You shouldn't, for instance, spend $10,000 to avoid a cost of $1,000, or maybe the risk is already manageable since the danger is so unlikely, and/or has such a low potential effect. A Toronto-based company probably doesn't require seismic server racks or other costly earthquake precautions.

> Your auditor will want to see that you have at least considered the potential consequences of completing the SOA and have decided to do so knowingly and voluntarily.

## 5. Finalize Your Application's SOA

Describe whether or not you implemented each control specified in Annex A and explain your reasoning.
> You'll detail the date the control was put into place and indicate whether it satisfies a statutory, contractual, operational, or compliance mandate.

> Most individuals utilize a spreadsheet to keep track of the SOA's extensive list of Annex A controls and the data that go along with them. Thus, any written work that can be conveniently divided into chapters will do.

## 6. Make Sure that Your SOA is always up to date
Your SOA should be seen as a dynamic document.
> In order to maintain compliance with ISO 27001 requirements, it is necessary to regularly review and update your security measures.

> The controls you employ and how you've modified them to enhance your ISMS should be reflected in your SOA, which should be updated on a regular basis.

> [!NOTE] 
> What Annex(es) of ISO/IEC 27001 apply to a certain organization is detailed in an SOA. A security control may or may not be relevant to your company's ISMS. A justification must be provided if a given control is inapplicable.

#### Why ISO 27001?
To ensure comprehensive information security management and to gain trust from stakeholders.
#### What does an SOA do in ISO 27001?
It lists and justifies the security controls implemented in an ISMS.

If you want to get your hands on an ISO 27001 certification, you'll need to submit an SOA. kido.

SOAs often take the form of an Excel spreadsheet since they detail the Annex A controls established by your company.

Please detail the implementation and last assessment dates for each control listed in Annex A, as well as whether or not it has been applied and the rationale for doing so.

Since SOAs are ever-evolving documents that should reflect the state of your ISMS at any given time, a revision history is also a good idea.

You must provide an explanation (or justification) for why an Annex A control is not relevant to your ISMS if you choose not to apply it.

It helps in implementing your data security plan.

It acts as a roadmap for both internal and external audits, including those required for certification

It gives you a living record to use in keeping track of and bettering your ISMS.
