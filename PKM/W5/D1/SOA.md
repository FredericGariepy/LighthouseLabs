# Writing Statement of Applicability (SOA)

## ISO 27001 SOA: What Is It?
Certification to ISO 27001 calls for an SOA. Essentially, it's a declaration of which security rules from Annex A apply to your organization's ISMS and which don't.

Why ISO 27001?
To ensure comprehensive information security management and to gain trust from stakeholders.
What does an SOA do in ISO 27001?
It lists and justifies the security controls implemented in an ISMS.

If you want to get your hands on an ISO 27001 certification, you'll need to submit an SOA. kido.

SOAs often take the form of an Excel spreadsheet since they detail the Annex A controls established by your company.

Please detail the implementation and last assessment dates for each control listed in Annex A, as well as whether or not it has been applied and the rationale for doing so.

Since SOAs are ever-evolving documents that should reflect the state of your ISMS at any given time, a revision history is also a good idea.

You must provide an explanation (or justification) for why an Annex A control is not relevant to your ISMS if you choose not to apply it.
