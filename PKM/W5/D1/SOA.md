# Writing Statement of Applicability (SOA)

## ISO 27001 SOA: What Is It?
ISO 27001: This is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS).

Annex A: This is a key part of ISO 27001. It contains a list of controls (security measures)

Statement of Applicability (SOA): The SOA is a crucial document that organizations must create as part of their ISMS. It lists all the controls from Annex A and specifies which ones are applicable to the organization.

For each control, the SOA should detail:
- Whether the control is implemented or not.
- How it is implemented (if it is).
- The justification(rational) for its inclusion or exclusion.


# How to Write an ISO 27001 SOA?  (6 steps)
## 1. _Recognize_ and _Assess_ Threats to Your ISMS
List all of your information assets \
and the potential data security risks associated with each one, as part of an ISO 27001 Risk Assessment.

> Following this, you may assign a risk owner, develop a strategy to address any vulnerabilities, and rank and prioritize risks based on their probability and effect. This document serves as a template for conducting a risk analysis in accordance with ISO 27001.

## 2. Define Your Risk Management Strategy
SO 27001 specifies four methods for handling potential dangers:
- __Mitigate__
> take precautions to lessen the possibility that it will really happen.
- __Avoid__
> eliminate the potential for harm by putting an end to the underlying conditions that might bring about an adverse outcome.
- __Transfer__
> outsource the danger to someone else (i.e., outsource security efforts to another company, purchase insurance, etc.)
- __Accept__
> if the possible loss is less than the expense of preventing the risk, you should take it.

Risk Treatment plan
> After compiling a list of potential threats, you must now choose how to address each one. A Risk Treatment plan is a document that specifies the risks that need to be addressed, who is responsible for them, how they will be addressed (either by avoiding them or accepting them), and when they will be addressed.

## 3. Settle on the Preventative Measures in Terms of Security
## 4. Make a Tally of the Controls you Won't be Utilizing and the Reasons Why
## 5. Finalize Your Application's SOA
## 6. Make Sure that Your SOA is always up to date





#### Why ISO 27001?
To ensure comprehensive information security management and to gain trust from stakeholders.
#### What does an SOA do in ISO 27001?
It lists and justifies the security controls implemented in an ISMS.

If you want to get your hands on an ISO 27001 certification, you'll need to submit an SOA. kido.

SOAs often take the form of an Excel spreadsheet since they detail the Annex A controls established by your company.

Please detail the implementation and last assessment dates for each control listed in Annex A, as well as whether or not it has been applied and the rationale for doing so.

Since SOAs are ever-evolving documents that should reflect the state of your ISMS at any given time, a revision history is also a good idea.

You must provide an explanation (or justification) for why an Annex A control is not relevant to your ISMS if you choose not to apply it.

It helps in implementing your data security plan.

It acts as a roadmap for both internal and external audits, including those required for certification

It gives you a living record to use in keeping track of and bettering your ISMS.
