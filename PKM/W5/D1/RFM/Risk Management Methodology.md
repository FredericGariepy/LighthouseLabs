## Case Study:
Risk Management Methodology for Hierarchical Access Ltd (DE)

the most significant risk, potential for a data breach. \
Impact: Confidentiality (sensitive customer data) \
Impact: company's reputation.

Second significant risk, supply chain disruptions. \
Impact: availability.

Needs: formal RMF to: identify, assess, and manage risks on an ongoing basis. \
Risk Assessment process, to identify potential risks and prioritize them based on their potential impact.

Assumptions
- DE has a small management team, with limited resources available for Risk Management.
- DE operates in a competitive market with many other providers of internet access and web hosting services.
- DE's reputation for reliability and high-quality service is a critical component of its success.
- DE relies heavily on its internet and hosting infrastructure, which is subject to both technical and operational risks.
Objectives & Deliverables

## Deliverables

Your Risk Methodology for DE should include the following components:
1. Purpose, scope, and users
2. Risk Assessment:
    1. The process: Explain what process you might follow. List 3 or more individuals or groups you might involve & why.
    2. Assets, vulnerabilities, and threats: Based on the information provided by DE, list the 3 main threats you expect DE to face and the challenges you expect them to face while managing these threats; reflect back on vulnerabilities and threats.
    3. Determining the risk owners: In examination of three different risks, create a “chain” of ownership of the risk from ground level to senior executive level. Explain what and how each owner may contribute to the chain.
    4. Impact and likelihood: Create a table that lists three threats or risks. Reflect and document the effect of these risks on C, I, or A or more than one of these, to what extent (from 0 to 10) and how likely (0 to 5)?
    5. Risk acceptance criteria: Explain how the most likely / highest risk item may impact DE and explain why some items in the table may be “ignored” or “minimized” based on the information provided by DE – reflect back on your risk assignments.
3.  Risk Treatment: Summarize the 3 main threats you have identified above, what recommended mitigations or responses you recommend for each and what priority you would give each one.
    1. Be sure to explain your prioritizations and your recommended responses. Don’t forget to reference industry standard frameworks to aid you in deciding on your recommended mitigations or responses.



Objectives

Your task is to develop a Risk Methodology for DE that will help the company identify and manage the risks it faces. Your methodology should include an explanation on how to create the following components:

    Risk Identification: identify the potential risks that DE faces, including both internal and external risks.
    Risk Assessment: assess the likelihood and potential impact of each risk, using a risk matrix or similar tool.
    Risk Management: develop a set of Risk Management strategies that DE can use to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of each identified risk.
