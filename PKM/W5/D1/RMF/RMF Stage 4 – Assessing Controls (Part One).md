 Purpose of the Assess Step?
> the purpose of the Assess step is to determine that selected security and privacy controls are implemented correctly, operate as intended, produce the desired outcome, and meet organizational or system security and privacy requirement


-    How to develop a security assessment plan
-    to assess controls as per the security assessment plan


# Assess stage, you complete four tasks

1. Develop security assessment plan
2. Assess control compliance
3. Prepare security assessment report
4. Conduct remediation


# first task in the Assess stage is to develop, review, and approve a plan
Basically, Security assessment plans describe what controls will be assessed.

What Information do Assessment Plans Provide?
- identify system, component, and organization-related roles and responsibilities
- assessment procedures for each security and privacy control
- identify the type of assessment to be conducted, such as development testing, initial authorization, re-authorization, or continuous monitoring. (part of authorize)

The purpose of the security assessment plan __approval__ is two-fold:
1. To establish the appropriate expectations for the security control assessment.
2. To bound the level of effort for the security control assessment. An approved security assessment plan helps to ensure that an appropriate level of resources is applied toward determining security control effectiveness.

#### Control Coverage and Control Depth
Control __coverage__ can be: comprehensive(high), focused(mid), or basic(low) 

Control __Depth__ how rigorously selected controls will be assessed

#### Assessment Optimization / determine required level of independence.
