# Limitations of a SIEM
- The __SIEM itself does NOT monitor__ events as they happen throughout the enterprise in real time,
  but rather uses log data recorded by other software to determine that an event occurred.
- __SIEMs DON'T replace enterprise security controls__ such as intrusion prevention systems, firewalls or antivirus technologies.
- SIEMs cannot always provide complete __context on _unstructured data___.
> This can lead to false alerts,
>
> and security teams can find it difficult to diagnose and research security events
>
> because of the high volume of alerts and data provided by the SIEM.

- Responses to alerts can be delayed or overlooked because analysts lack an understanding of which alerts need attention.
