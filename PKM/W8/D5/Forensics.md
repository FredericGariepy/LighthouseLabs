Disk imaging: creating a bit-by-bit copy of a digital storage device for analysis.

Memory analysis: analyzing volatile data in computer memory to identify running processes, network connections, and other system activities.

Network forensics: collecting and analyzing network traffic to detect and respond to security incidents.

Malware analysis: analyzing the code, behaviour, and impact of malware to understand its purpose and origin.

Data carving: extracting files and data from a digital storage device based on file signatures and header information.

File analysis: analyzing file metadata, contents, and structure to identify potential evidence.

Timeline analysis: creating a chronological sequence of events related to a security incident using system logs and other data sources.

Forensic analysis tools: there are various forensic analysis tools used in digital forensics investigations, such as EnCase, Forensic Tool Kit (FTK), Autopsy, and Sleuth Kit.

Password cracking: using specialized software and techniques to recover passwords from encrypted data.

Hashing: verifying the integrity of data by comparing the hash value of the original data with that of the copied data
