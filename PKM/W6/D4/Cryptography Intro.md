- __Authentication__: the sender and receiver can confirm each other's identity and the origin/destination of the information.
- __Integrity__: the information cannot be altered in storage or transit between sender and intended receiver without the alteration being detected.
- __Non-repudiation__: the creator/sender of the information cannot deny at a later stage their intentions in the creation or transmission of the information.
- __Confidentiality__: ensuring data is only accessible to authorized personnel and kept private from unauthorized entities.
- __Authorization__: allowing authorized persons access to specific data.
- __Key management__: cryptographic keys are securely stored, distributed, and managed.
