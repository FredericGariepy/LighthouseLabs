## Pre-defined Variables
The Bash shell includes the following predefined variables:

- `$?` which stores the exit status of the last executed program;
- `$#` which stores the number of command line parameters;
- `$$` which stores the PID (Process Identifier) ​​value of the shell script being executed;
- `$@` which stores the value of all passed parameters, similar to the argv variable present in the C and C++ programming languages;
- `$!` which stores the PID of the last background process, which helps track the process as work is carried out;
- `$0`, ..., `$9` which stores the values ​​of all command line parameters separately
