Workflow: a short description of the steps to be taken to successfully monitor and document the logs in the network
Consider what you will monitor, when, and how often.
  
Programming: Outline what programming tools you will use to successfully complete the task. Be sure to include key commands and/or scripts that you will use or create.
Expected Output: What are the expected results of the commands or scripts you are planning to use? Why are they important or useful?
Documentation: How will you capture and document the monitoring process? Consider the timing and how you will share it with your manager.
Unusual Behaviour: Identify what elements in your monitoring would constitute a “flag” to alert your manager.
Potential Iterations: What elements of your workflow would you want to improve, and why? Identify some ways you could develop skills to support this improvement.




Report Format

Organize all the information you gathered into a report and be sure to include the following: * Table of Contents * Introduction * Solutions Section (Where you discuss your script and how it functions) * Potential iterations Section (where you discuss potential improvements) * Conclusion * References
References

References are crucial for credibility, validating arguments, and avoiding plagiarism. References enable readers to verify information; build on existing knowledge, and uphold ethical standards while promoting transparency. All the resources you access should be listed in a References List at the end of your work.

You may use tools, like Citation Machine, to generate citations for your work.
Instruction

The widely accepted citation format in the cyber security industry is the APA format. Use this format for all projects in the program. Once you enter the industry, you may follow a different citation style if instructed by your organization.
