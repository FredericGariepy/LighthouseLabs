Why analyzing log files instead of using a network intrusion detection system?
- HTTPS -> SSL
- No NIDS deployed
- High traffic load makes
- NIDS are designed to work on the TCP/IP level, and thus they may not be as effective on the HTTP layer
- IDS evasion techniques (HTTP, encoding, fragmenting, ...)
