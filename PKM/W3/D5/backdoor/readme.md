This is one method of using a backdoor vulnerability and how it can be exploited to transfer pieces of information between computers.

Socket connection between the server and the client.

Use two different Linux computers, where one is the server, and the other one is the exploited client.

The connection should occur in port 4444, but you may need to debug the code first.

### `socket.bind()`
method: This method binds the server to a specific IP address and binds the port to listen to incoming requests on that IP and port.
