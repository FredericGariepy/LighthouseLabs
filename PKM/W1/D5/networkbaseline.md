# Network Baselines

(cacti)[https://www.cacti.net/] includes a fully distributed and fault tolerant data collection framework.
Cacti is a robust performance and fault management framework and a frontend to RRDTool - a Time Series Database (TSDB). It stores all of the necessary information to create performance management Graphs in either MariaDB or MySQL, and then leverages its various Data Collectors to populate RRDTool based TSDB with that performance data.
Cacti is also a LAMP stack Web Application.


common fields you will find in a network traffic chart:
- bps:
> (bps) bit per second.
> This is not to be confused with byte per second, which is Bps.
> There are 8 bits in a byte, therefore bps is much smaller than Bps.
- In/Ingress:
  > This refers to how much traffic is coming into the network.
- Out/Egress:
  > This refers to how much traffic is leaving the network.
- Average, Standard Deviation, Minimum and Maximum:
  > These statistics are extremely important when it comes to establishing a baseline
  > and creating alerts on what will be considered "abnormal" network traffic.

Reading
All networks have a typical traffic pattern throughout the average workday
Depending on the organizationâ€™s core hours of operation and volume of traffic on the network.
Traffic patterns may be low outside the core hours of operation and high during working hours.

In Cyber Security, network baselines refer to the normal or expected behavior of a network.
This includes information about the devices, protocols, and traffic that are typically present on the network,
as well as the patterns of usage and communication.

Network baselines can be used to detect and respond to security incidents and anomalies
by allowing security teams to identify abnormal behavior that deviates from the established baseline.

According to Cisco, the objective of a baseline is to:

1. Determine the current status of network devices.
2. Compare that status to standard performance guidelines.
3. Set thresholds to alert you when the status exceeds those guidelines.
The baseline takes snapshots of the network when you know it's normal, so you have something to use as a reference point.

Establishing the Network Baseline - Process
A network baseline is established by recording information about the devices and traffic that are measured during known normal operation.
Comprehensive data about the typical usage and status of the network provides the ability to compare future information against what is known to be the norm to highlight inconsistencies for investigation.

Data *should be* collected on various aspects of network traffic, such as:
- List of devices in use on the network and their IP addresses and ports
- List of protocols and services in use
- Amount and timing of traffic
- Patterns of communication and usage
- Records of user and device authentication

Once it is clearly established what your network looks like under normal operation,
it becomes easier to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
This is done by monitoring network activity in real time and
comparing current activity to the recorded baseline to identify significant departures from usual operation.

For example, changes in the IP address, port, or protocols used by a device that are not part of the established baseline,
could indicate a potential security incident.
