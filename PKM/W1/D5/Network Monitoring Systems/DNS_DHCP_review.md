How They Work
DHCP:

Operation: When a device connects to a network, it sends a DHCPDISCOVER message to the network. A DHCP server responds with a DHCPOFFER message containing an IP address and configuration details. The device then sends a DHCPREQUEST message to accept the offer, and the server responds with a DHCPACK message to finalize the configuration.
Lease Time: IP addresses are assigned for a specific period, known as the lease time. Devices must renew their lease periodically.
DNS:

Operation: When a device needs to resolve a domain name, it sends a DNS query to a DNS server. The server responds with the corresponding IP address if it has the information. If not, it queries other DNS servers until it finds the answer.
DNS Records: Different types of DNS records include A records (IPv4 addresses), AAAA records (IPv6 addresses), MX records (mail servers), CNAME records (canonical names), and more.
Key Components
DHCP:

DHCP Server: Assigns IP addresses and network configurations.
DHCP Client: Requests and receives IP configuration from the server.
DHCP Relay: Forwards DHCP messages between clients and servers across different subnets.
DNS:

DNS Server: Responds to DNS queries with the appropriate IP addresses or other DNS records.
DNS Client (Resolver): Sends queries to DNS servers to resolve domain names.
Authoritative DNS Server: Holds DNS records for specific domains and responds to queries about those domains.
Recursive DNS Server: Queries other DNS servers on behalf of the client to resolve domain names it doesnâ€™t have cached.
Interactions
DHCP and DNS:
DHCP can provide devices with the addresses of DNS servers as part of the network configuration.
Some DHCP servers can dynamically update DNS records to reflect the current IP address assignments, ensuring that domain names resolve to the correct IP addresses.
Example Scenario
Device Connection:
DHCP: A laptop connects to a network and requests an IP address. The DHCP server assigns it an IP address along with the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses.
DNS: The laptop wants to visit www.example.com. It sends a DNS query to the DNS server address provided by DHCP. The DNS server responds with the IP address of www.example.com.
