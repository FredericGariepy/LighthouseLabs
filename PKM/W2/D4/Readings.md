Network monitoring is more or less the same, except that there are no engines and oil filters. It looks into:

- Network devices: laptops, mobile devices, printers, routers, switches, and **firewalls**.
- Links: *Links enable devices to communicate* and include **network interfaces** and **physical wiring** such as fiber optic cables.
- Servers: Email servers, web servers, application servers, and data centers are some of the most critical assets of an organization.
- Service providers: from collaboration software such as GSuite to cloud services such as AWS.
