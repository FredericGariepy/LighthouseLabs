## IOC
IOC (Indicator of Compromise): These are artifacts observed on a network or in an operating system that indicate a potential breach or malicious activity. Examples include unusual traffic patterns, unexpected changes in file attributes, or the presence of known malware signatures.

## IOA
IOA (Indicator of Attack): These are signs that an attack is currently in progress. Unlike IOCs, which are more about the aftermath, IOAs focus on detecting the behaviors and tactics used by attackers during an active threat, such as unusual user activity or the use of tools to escalate privileges.

## VA
VA (Vulnerability Assessment): This is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing the vulnerabilities in a system. It involves scanning systems to detect weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers, such as outdated software or misconfigured settings.

## INTEL
INTEL (Cyber Threat Intelligence): This involves collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information about potential or current threats to an organization. It includes data on threat actors, their methods, and their motives, and helps organizations anticipate and mitigate cyber threats proactively.

## XDR
XDR (Extended Detection and Response): This is a security solution that integrates data from multiple security products into a cohesive system to detect, investigate, and respond to threats across various security layers. XDR provides enhanced visibility, correlation, and automation, combining endpoint, network, and cloud security.

## SIEM
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management): This is a platform that collects and analyzes security data from various sources within an IT environment. SIEM systems provide real-time monitoring, threat detection, event correlation, and incident response capabilities by aggregating logs and alerts from different systems and applying advanced analytics.

## UBA
UBA (User Behavior Analytics): This involves the use of machine learning and analytics to monitor and analyze user behavior within a network. UBA detects abnormal behavior patterns that could indicate potential insider threats or compromised accounts by establishing baselines of normal behavior and identifying deviations from these baselines.
