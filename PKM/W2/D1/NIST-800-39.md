# CHAPTER TWO
## BASIC CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH RISK MANAGEMENT
This chapter describes the fundamental concepts associated with managing information
security risk across an organization including: 
1. the [components of risk management](#components-of-risk-management)
2. the multitiered risk management approach
3. risk management at Tier 1 (organization level)
4. risk management at Tier 2 (mission/business process level)
5. risk management at Tier 3 (information system level)
6. risk related to trust and trustworthiness
7. the effects of organizational culture on risk
8. the relationships among key risk management concepts

## COMPONENTS OF RISK MANAGEMENT
Managing risk is a complex, multifaceted activity that requires the involvement of the entire
organization—from senior leaders/executives providing the strategic vision and top-level goals
and objectives for the organization; to mid-level leaders planning, executing, and managing
projects; to individuals on the front lines operating the information systems supporting the
organization’s missions/business functions.

## Risk management (1,2,3,4)
is a comprehensive process that requires organizations to:
1. _Frame risk_
> i.e., establish the context for risk-based decisions
2. Assess risk
3. Respond to risk once determined
4. Monitor risk

1, 2, 3, 4 on an ongoing basis using effective organizational communications and
 a feedback loop for continuous improvement in the risk-related activities of organizations.
 
Risk management is carried out as a **holistic**,
organizationwide activity that addresses risk from the strategic level to the tactical level,
ensuring that riskbased decision making is integrated into every aspect of the organization.

The following sections briefly describe each of the *four risk management components*.

### FRAME
   > The first component of risk management addresses how organizations frame risk or establish a
   > risk context—that is, describing the environment in which risk-based decisions are made.
   >
   > The purpose of the risk framing component is to produce a risk management strategy that addresses
   > how organizations intend to assess risk, respond to risk, and monitor risk—making explicit and
   > transparent the risk perceptions that organizations routinely use in making both investment and
   > operational decisions.
   >
   > The risk frame establishes a foundation for managing risk and delineate
   > the boundaries for risk-based decisions within organizations.

*Establishing* a realistic and credible *risk frame* requires that organizations identify:

1. risk assumptions
   > e.g. assumptions about the threats, vulnerabilities, consequences/impact,
   > and likelihood of occurrence that affect how risk is assessed, responded to, and monitored over time
2. risk constraints
   > e.g., constraints on the risk assessment, response, and monitoring alternatives under consideration
3. risk tolerance
  > levels of risk, types of risk, and degree of risk uncertainty that are acceptable
4. priorities and trade-offs
  >  the relative importance of missions/business functions, trade-offs among
  > different types of risk that organizations face, time frames in which organizations must address
  >risk, and any factors of uncertainty that organizations consider in risk responses)

The risk framing component and the associated risk management strategy also include any strategic-level
decisions on how risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation, is to be managed by senior leaders/executives.

### Assess risk
Assess risk within the context of the organizational risk frame.

The purpose of the risk assessment component is to
identify:
1. threats to organizations (i.e., operations, assets, or individuals) or threats directed
through organizations against other organizations or the Nation;
2. (ii) vulnerabilities internal and external to organizations;
3. (iii) the harm (i.e., consequences/impact) to organizations that may occur given the potential for threats exploiting vulnerabilities;
4. (iv) the likelihood that harm will occur.

The end result is a determination of risk (i.e., the degree of harm and likelihood of
harm occurring). To support the risk assessment component, organizations identify:
1. (i) the tools, techniques, and methodologies that are used to assess risk;
2. (ii) the assumptions related to risk assessments;
3. (iii) the constraints that may affect risk assessments;
4. (iv) roles and responsibilities;
5. (v) how risk assessment information is collected, processed, and communicated throughout organizations;
6. (vi) how risk assessments are conducted within organizations;
7. (vii) the frequency of risk assessments; and
8. (viii) how threat information is obtained (i.e., sources and methods).
