# CHAPTER TWO
## BASIC CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH RISK MANAGEMENT
This chapter describes the fundamental concepts associated with managing information
security risk across an organization including: 
1. the [components of risk management](#components-of-risk-management)
2. the [multitiered risk management approach](#multitiered-risk-management)
3. risk management at Tier 1 (organization level)
4. risk management at Tier 2 (mission/business process level)
5. risk management at Tier 3 (information system level)
6. risk related to trust and trustworthiness
7. the effects of organizational culture on risk
8. the relationships among key risk management concepts

## COMPONENTS OF RISK MANAGEMENT
Managing risk is a complex, multifaceted activity that requires the involvement of the entire
organization—from senior leaders/executives providing the strategic vision and top-level goals
and objectives for the organization; to mid-level leaders planning, executing, and managing
projects; to individuals on the front lines operating the information systems supporting the
organization’s missions/business functions.

## Risk management (1,2,3,4)
is a comprehensive process that requires organizations to:
1. _Frame risk_
> i.e., establish the context for risk-based decisions
2. _Assess risk_
3. _Respond to risk_ once determined
4. _Monitor risk_

1, 2, 3, 4 on an ongoing basis using effective organizational communications and
 a feedback loop for continuous improvement in the risk-related activities of organizations.
 
Risk management is carried out as a **holistic**,
organizationwide activity that addresses risk from the strategic level to the tactical level,
ensuring that riskbased decision making is integrated into every aspect of the organization.

The following sections briefly describe each of the *four risk management components*.

### FRAME
   > The first component of risk management addresses how organizations frame risk or establish a
   > risk context—that is, describing the environment in which risk-based decisions are made.
   >
   > The purpose of the risk framing component is to produce a risk management strategy that addresses
   > how organizations intend to assess risk, respond to risk, and monitor risk—making explicit and
   > transparent the risk perceptions that organizations routinely use in making both investment and
   > operational decisions.
   >
   > The risk frame establishes a foundation for managing risk and delineate
   > the boundaries for risk-based decisions within organizations.

*Establishing* a realistic and credible *risk frame* requires that organizations identify:

1. risk assumptions
   > e.g. assumptions about the threats, vulnerabilities, consequences/impact,
   > and likelihood of occurrence that affect how risk is assessed, responded to, and monitored over time
2. risk constraints
   > e.g., constraints on the risk assessment, response, and monitoring alternatives under consideration
3. risk tolerance
  > levels of risk, types of risk, and degree of risk uncertainty that are acceptable
4. priorities and trade-offs
  >  the relative importance of missions/business functions, trade-offs among
  > different types of risk that organizations face, time frames in which organizations must address
  >risk, and any factors of uncertainty that organizations consider in risk responses)

The risk framing component and the associated risk management strategy also include any strategic-level
decisions on how risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation, is to be managed by senior leaders/executives.

### ASSES risk
Assess risk within the context of the organizational risk frame.

The purpose of the risk assessment component is to
identify:
1. **Threats** to organizations
   > i.e. operations, assets, or individuals, or threats directed
   > through organizations against other organizations or the Nation
3. **Vulnerabilities** internal and external to organizations;
4.  **Harm**
   > i.e. consequences/impact to organizations that may occur given the potential for threats exploiting vulnerabilities
5. **Likelihood** that harm will occur.

The end result is a determination of risk
i.e. the degree of harm and likelihood of harm occurring.
To support the risk assessment component, organizations identify:
1. (i) the tools, techniques, and methodologies that are used to assess risk;
2. (ii) the assumptions related to risk assessments;
3. (iii) the constraints that may affect risk assessments;
4. (iv) roles and responsibilities;
5. (v) how risk assessment information is collected, processed, and communicated throughout organizations;
6. (vi) how risk assessments are conducted within organizations;
7. (vii) the frequency of risk assessments; and
8. (viii) how threat information is obtained (i.e., sources and methods).

### RESPOND to risk
The third component of risk management addresses how organizations respond to risk once that
risk is determined based on the results of risk assessments.

The purpose of the risk response component is to provide a consistent, organization-wide, response to risk in accordance with the organizational risk frame by:
1. (i) developing alternative courses of action for responding to risk;
2. (ii) evaluating the alternative courses of action;
3. (iii) determining appropriate courses of action consistent with organizational risk tolerance;
4. (iv) implementing risk responses based on selected courses of action.

To support the risk response component, organizations describe the types of risk responses that can be implemented
> i.e., accepting, avoiding, mitigating, sharing, or transferring risk.
Organizations also identify the tools, techniques, and methodologies used to develop courses of action for responding to risk, how courses of action are evaluated, and how risk responses are communicated across organizations and as appropriate, to external entities.
> external entities: e.g., external service providers, supply chain partners.

### MONITOR risk
The fourth component of risk management addresses how organizations monitor risk over time.
The purpose of the risk monitoring component is to:
1. (i) **verify that planned risk response measures are implemented** and information security requirements derived from/traceable to organizational missions/business functions, federal legislation, directives, regulations, policies,
and standards, and guidelines, are satisfied;
2. (ii) determine the **ongoing effectiveness** of risk response measures following implementation;
3. (iii) **identify risk-impacting changes** to organizational information systems and the environments in which the systems operate

To support the risk monitoring component, organizations describe how compliance is verified and
how the ongoing effectiveness of risk responses is determined
> e.g.: the types of tools, techniques, and methodologies used to determine the sufficiency/correctness of risk responses and if risk mitigation measures are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
effect with regard to reducing risk.

In addition, organizations describe how changes that may impact the ongoing effectiveness of risk responses are monitored. 

As indicated in the four components of risk management described above, organizations also
consider external risk relationships, as appropriate.
Organizations identify external entities with which there is an actual or potential risk relationship
> i.e., organizations which could impose risks on, transfer risks to, or communicate risks to other organizations, as well as those to which organizations could impose, transfer, or communicate risks.
External risk relationships include, for example, suppliers, customers or served populations, mission/business partners, and/or service providers.
For organizations dealing with advanced persistent threats
> i.e., a long-term pattern of targeted, sophisticated attacks
the risk posed by external partners (especially suppliers in the supply chain) may become more pronounced.
Organizations establish practices for sharing riskrelated information
> e.g., threat and vulnerability information
with external entities, including those with which the organizations have a risk relationship as well as those which could supply or receive risk-related information
> e.g., Information Sharing and Analysis Centers [ISAC], Computer Emergency Response Teams [CERT].
