## NIST RMF Quick Start Guide ( W2 | D1 )
Access and review the resources and information available at [NIST’s Prepare Step page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/about-rmf/prepare-step) along with it's associated FAQ (with a focus on section 2 & 3).

FAQ section 2 & 3:

2. What is the Prepare step?
> The purpose of the Prepare step is to carry out essential risk management tasks at the organization, mission and business process, and
> system levels to establish context and help prepare the organization to manage its security and privacy risks using the Risk
> Management Framework (RMF).
>
> Prepare step tasks are completed before the Categorize step and support all subsequent Risk Management
> Framework steps and tasks.
>
> Ultimately, the intention of the Prepare step is to provide the information and resources necessary to
> successfully manage information security and privacy risk to the organization and its missions from the operation and use of systems.
3. What are some of the objectives and benefits of the Prepare step?
> The objectives and benefits of the Prepare step include:
> - Facilitating better **communication** between senior leaders and executives at the organization and mission and business process levels and system owners
> - Facilitating organization-wide **identification of common controls** and the **development of organizationally tailored control**
>   **baselines, reducing the workload on individual system owners and the cost of system development and asset protection
> - **Reducing the complexity** of the information technology and operations technology infrastructure using enterprise architecture concepts and models to consolidate, optimize, and standardize organizational systems, applications, and services
> - Identifying, **prioritizing**, and focusing resources on the organization’s high-value assets and high impact systems that require increased levels of protection and taking steps commensurate with the risk to such assets. 

## Task Instructions
Then use what you learn to assist you in the following scenario:

You are the head of cyber security for a start up company.
This company's main product is an online payment processor that must securely handle customer credit card information.
The company currently has only two developers, no formal security policies or procedures and the application is hosted in AWS and is accessed publicly over the internet via two dedicated web servers.
The information for your current user base of 200 people is stored on a server that is directly connected to the web servers for easy retrieval.

After reviewing the NIST quick start guide FAQ related to the prepare step,
perform the key preparation activties for the given scenario and identify the following:

1. The top 3 biggest risks to company security with explanations for your determination
2. Security controls that could compensate for the company's major risks
3. A strategy for implementing continous monitoring of company source code
4. Identify the company's high value assets

Now, review the Categorize Step page along with it's associated FAQ (with a focus on section 2 & 3).
Then using what you learned make a categorization determination around the company's database server and the potential impact on the organization if it is compromised in anyway,
be sure to address all elements of the CIA triad.
