Note on NIST.SP.800-37r2

- RMF addresses security and privacy risk from two perspectivesâ€”
an information system perspective and a common controls perspective.

- RMF is purposefully designed to be technology neutral.

- Maximize the use of automation, wherever possible, to increase the speed,
effectiveness, and efficiency of executing RMF steps.
