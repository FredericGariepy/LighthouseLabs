## COMPONENTS OF RISK MANAGEMENT
Managing risk is a complex, multifaceted activity that requires the involvement of the entire
organization—from senior leaders/executives providing the strategic vision and top-level goals
and objectives for the organization; to mid-level leaders planning, executing, and managing
projects; to individuals on the front lines operating the information systems supporting the
organization’s missions/business functions. Risk management is a comprehensive process that
requires organizations to: (i) frame risk (i.e., establish the context for risk-based decisions); (ii)
assess risk; (iii) respond to risk once determined; and (iv) monitor risk on an ongoing basis using
effective organizational communications and a feedback loop for continuous improvement in the
risk-related activities of organizations. Risk management is carried out as a holistic, organizationwide activity that addresses risk from the strategic level to the tactical level, ensuring that riskbased decision making is integrated into every aspect of the organization.13 The following
