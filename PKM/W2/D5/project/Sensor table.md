- **Sensor:** Generic sensor name
- **Description:** A short non-technical description of the sensor
- **System:** The endpoint that the sensor will be monitoring
- **IoCs:** The Indicators of Compromise that the sensor is expected to monitor
- **Rationale:** Why this sensor may have been chosen, linked to MITRE or some other framework information
- **Priority:** Based on the nature of Risk/IoC/SIL, etc.
- **Thresholds/ Assumptions:** Based on what is monitored, do we monitor for a high condition, a low condition or both and why? This column can also be used to specify any assumptions made

> Make sure you use SILs as part of your priority selection so she can arrange her dashboard to show the most important items.

| HTTP Load Time            | Monitors the time it takes for the page to load. | Linux      | Malicious Redirects, DDoS Attacks, Content Injection | Unexpected changes in load time can indicate anomalies or performance-related issues that could indicate a security breach or compromise. | Medium (SIL of high, see assumptions) | Changes of 20% over the average load. SIL based on the fact that BIG DOG does NOT have a large Web Presence, the Linux web server being internal and outward facing (Assumption). Low impact on CIA (specifically A) but higher chance of compromise. SIL set to high. |
