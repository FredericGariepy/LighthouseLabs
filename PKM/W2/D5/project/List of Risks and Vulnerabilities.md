Workflow:
1. List assets, describe OS / software versions
2. Add related vulnerabilties (search MITRE, CVE , NVD)
3. List labeled assets in descending priority, based on category.
4. Assign CIA value to asset
5. Assign SIL value to asset
6. Calculate(vuln + asset SIL) to get CVSS Scores

Goals:
- Created a list of assets owned by the Big Dog organization and their vulnerabilities.
- Decided on the risk each discovered vulnerability might pose to the Big Dog organization and prioritized them.
- Discussed your findings and decisions in a small group.
- Completed the research for case study Cat Scan II
- Understood the process of discovering asset vulnerabilities and how to rate & prioritize risks


1. Assets + OS/Software versions
